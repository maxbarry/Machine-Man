<h5>CHAPTER 
THREE</h5>
<p>My boss visited me the day before I was
due to be discharged. Until this point, the only contact I&rsquo;d
had from him had been via e-mail. &ldquo;Hey, Charlie,&rdquo; he said
weakly, his eyes shifting away. I made him uncomfortable. Not because
of the stump. He had felt this way about me since forever. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
doing great, they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting out tomorrow.
Can I come back to work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you want to...&rdquo; He
looked sweaty. &ldquo;You want to... get back on the horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Also, I have a new
project.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrific.&rdquo; His lips
trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am entitled to perform
free-ranging research,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s part of my
spec.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is, Charlie. You
know we&rsquo;ll support you in whatever you want to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to get back to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the labs... they&rsquo;re
not equipped for a... for someone with your... able-bodied... issues.
I mean, we&rsquo;ll take care of it. It&rsquo;s just, right now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t need any of that. Oh, except for tomorrow.
If you could arrange for someone to carry me down to the labs, that
would be great. But after tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My boss went silent for a few moments.
His name was D. Peters. I forget what the D stood for. E-mails from
him, they just showed up as D. Peters. &ldquo;Charlie, if you want to
take a few months&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Just get someone to carry me, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
