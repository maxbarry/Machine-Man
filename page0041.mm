<p>Lola rose from the table. She offered me her hand, and I took it. As
the Contours extended to full height, her eyes held mine. Sunlight
bouncing off a building across the street played across her cheeks.
Stray hairs that had escaped her pony-tail glowed orange. I felt
myself lifting out of my body, because nobody had looked at me like
this in my entire life. That&rsquo;s how it felt: like I was leaving
physicality behind, becoming something weightless and untouchable.</p>
<p>A hard shard of light skipped across Lola&rsquo;s face. It was a
reflection. I turned, because by now I&rsquo;d heard the motor, and
recognized it. Outside the cafe, a large white van jumped the curb
and began to disgorge security guards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think&mdash;&rdquo; I said, but that was all I managed
before they burst into the cafe, and people began to scream and
overturn tables. Carl was there, and when he saw me he stopped dead
and pointed his gun at me and yelled for me to <em>let go of that
woman right now</em>. I felt exasperated, because this was really
terrible timing for me. That was my mistake: thinking he wouldn&rsquo;t
really shoot.</p>
