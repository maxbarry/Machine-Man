<h5>CHAPTER 
THIRTEEN</h5>
<p>I went to work with a spring in my
step. Not literally. If you want to be literal, I went to work with
servo-hydraulics in my step. I mean I was happy. I was optimistic. I
was glad to be alive. I read somewhere that for a person to be
content with life, they need two out of three things: health, work,
and love. Right now, I was all over that. I was a triple threat.</p>
<p>It was early days with Lola. I knew
that. But this thing we had, it was something. It was something.</p>
<p>As I strolled toward the Glass Room, I
tried to think what I should do next, on the project. Maybe I had
gotten too caught up with the hand problem. Did I have to let the
fact that I hadn&rsquo;t come up with a perfect hand design block the
whole project? No. No, I did not. Screw the hand. I would use
something stop-gap. Then I could attach an arm.</p>
<p>I smiled. I liked the idea of going
back to Lola with a new arm. She had been pleased enough just to see
me in the legs.</p>
