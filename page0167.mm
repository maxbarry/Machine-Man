<p>I fell. The alley
floor passed over my head and I felt the terrible mass of my body
filling with kinetic energy, preparing to drive my biological parts
into the ground. I tried to twist in mid-air and my body ignored me.
Something exploded and it was a moment before I realized it wasn&rsquo;t
me. It was the car, a live preview of what was about to happen to me
when I hit that alley. I screamed at my body&rsquo;s betrayal,
because of all the times for it to stop listening&mdash;</p>
<p>My hooves slammed
into the roadtop. I gasped, expecting to fall over, then I gasped
again, because I didn&rsquo;t. I was perfectly balanced. I felt
reproval from my body: <em>And you doubted me</em>. I felt like crying.
I loved my body. I loved it so very much.</p>
<p>Carl appeared above
me. He peered out from the parking garage, surrounded by so much
swirling concrete dust that I could barely see him. Which meant he
could barely see me. He was hanging himself out there, thinking I
must be sprawled dead or broken. <em>Now</em>, said my parts, and I
said; <em>Yes yes yes</em>. We got the gun-arm up, my parts and I, and
we bellowed gunfire until we couldn&rsquo;t see the garage any more.</p>
