<p>I fell. The alley
floor passed over my head and I felt the terrible mass of my body,
weightless but filling with kinetic energy, preparing to drive my
biological parts a foot into the ground. I tried to twist in mid-air
and my body ignored me. Something exploded and it was a moment before
I realized it wasn&rsquo;t me. It was the car, a live preview of what
would happen when I hit that alley. I screamed at my body&rsquo;s
betrayal, because of all the times for it to stop listening to me,
now was the worst.</p>
<p>My hooves slammed
into the roadtop. I gasped, expecting to fall over, then I gasped
again, because I didn&rsquo;t. I was perfectly balanced. I felt
reproval from my body: <em>And you doubted me</em>. I felt like crying.
I loved my body. I loved it so very much.</p>
<p>Carl appeared above
me, peering out from the parking garage. He was surrounded by so much
swirling concrete dust that he took a moment to spot me. It was my
opportunity. I felt it with every part of my body. We got the gun-arm
up, my parts and I, and we bellowed gunfire until we couldn&rsquo;t
see the garage any more.</p>
