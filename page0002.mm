<p>As a boy, I wanted to be a train. I
didn&rsquo;t realize this was unusual&mdash;that other kids played
<em>with</em> trains, not as them.
They enjoyed the management. Constructing tracks and having trains
not fall off them. Smashing them into things. I didn&rsquo;t
understand that. What I liked about playing trains was pretending my
body was two hundred tons of unstoppable steel. A precisely tuned
engine of pistons and valves moving at a hundred miles per hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You
mean <em>robots</em>,&rdquo;
said my best friend Jeremy. &ldquo;You want to play robots.&rdquo; He
was right. Trains were just the closest thing I knew.</p>
