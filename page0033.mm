<p>Before I left to meet Lola Banks for lunch, I stopped by the
Repository to get to dressed. I had a lot of legs in there, and some
fingers, and a hand that wasn&rsquo;t very practical but I liked too
much to scrap. It could crush bricks. The impractical part was it
crushed everything, whether you wanted it to or not. It was very
twitchy.</p>
<p>After a few minutes&rsquo; deliberation, I chose Contour legs. These
were a matched titanium set with a bucket seat I wore around my hips.
You didn&rsquo;t walk in them so much as sit there and let them take
you places. They weren&rsquo;t my favorites, but they had the
advantage of a vaguely natural look, such that they might go
unnoticed beneath my jeans. Most of my other legs didn&rsquo;t fit
under jeans. They were also heavy, and noisy, and vented gases.</p>
<p>As I clambered out of my Work legs and into the Contours, I realized
the irony of the situation. The first time I met Lola, at the
hospital, I told her I didn&rsquo;t care about a natural look. But
here I was climbing into a set of legs chosen primarily because they
didn&rsquo;t resemble the lower half of a Humvee. I was beginning to
care what people thought. I was becoming aware of social niceties. If
this kept up, soon I would be totally normal.</p>
