<p>Before I went out to meet Lola Banks for lunch, I stopped by the
Repository to get to dressed. I had a lot of legs in there, and some
fingers, and a hand that wasn&rsquo;t very practical but I liked too
much to scrap. It could crush bricks. The impractical part was it
crushed everything, whether you wanted it to or not. It was very
twitchy.</p>
<p>After a few minutes&rsquo; deliberation, I chose the Contour legs.
These were a matched titanium set with a bucket seat I wore around my
hips. You didn&rsquo;t walk in them so much as sit there and let them
take you places. They weren&rsquo;t my favorites, but they had the
advantage of a vaguely natural look, such that they might go
unnoticed beneath my jeans. Most of my other legs did not fit under
jeans. They also tended to be heavy, and loud, and vent gases.</p>
<p>As I clambered out of my Work legs and into the Contours, I smiled at
the irony of the situation. The first time I met Lola, at the
hospital, I&rsquo;d said I didn&rsquo;t care about a natural look.
But here I was climbing into a set of legs chosen primarily because
they least resembled the lower half of a military all-terrain
vehicle. Thanks to Lola, I was beginning to care what people thought.
I could perceive social niceties. If this kept up, maybe soon I would
be completely normal.</p>
