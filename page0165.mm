<p>I raised my
gun-arm. Carl&rsquo;s head turned toward me. Light fell on his face.
I saw his eyes lock onto my arm, widen as he realized what it was. I
was going to obliterate him. We both knew it. He was going to die in
little pieces and I would weep beside them over whatever he had done
to Lola&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Then Carl flicked
his forearm and a large, solid object hurtled at my body. Even before
I saw what it was, this was the moment I realized I had seriously
underestimated the situation. Because I was stronger than Carl, and
faster and smarter and better armed, but I had never fought anyone in
my entire life. I had almost hit a girl in elementary school, but
before I could decide to do it, she pushed me over. That was the
extent of my hand-to-hand combat experience. Carl was trained. And he
had a car battery: he had <em>loaded up</em> with car batteries, and I
flinched away. My gun-arm tore a chunk out of the ceiling. That
should have been Carl. The first battery ricocheted off my hip, and I
thought, <em>Wait a minute, that can&rsquo;t even hurt me</em>, then
the second hit me square in the back and I screamed, because some of
that was flesh. I staggered in a circle, and by then Carl was on top
of me, his sledgehammer arms coming at me like two dark freight
trains, and I had already lost.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>, something I
registered at the last second as a car battery. I am not proud of my
failure to anticipate Carl throwing things, but, in my defense, 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>a car battery? 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>And in the instant
before I opened fire, I saw Lola, her face peering past his shoulder,
her mouth forming an O of surprise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;
If we see Lola is okay, we LOSE THE RAGE. MUST NOT SEE THAT LOLA IS
OKAY. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;
The thing is, Carl shouldn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s being tracked&mdash;at
least, not by Charlie. He should expect BF to come after him&mdash;that&rsquo;s
why he&rsquo;s trying to dig out the locator&mdash;but Charlie is a
surprise. However, he has heard Charlie coming up the ramp. Charlie
has called out. Lola has called back. Lola would think: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
run to Charlie!&rdquo; Carl would say: &ldquo;Wait, it&rsquo;s not
safe, think of his parts.&rdquo; &ldquo;We have to get this tracker
off as fast as possible.&rdquo; &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;
Should have a couple of cars slam into him. Either they roll down
(balanced/restrained somehow) or are driven. I think he must have
been stacking them?
