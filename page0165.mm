<p>I raised my
gun-arm. Carl&rsquo;s head turned toward me. Light fell across his
face and I saw his eyes lock onto my arm, widen as he realized what
it was. I was going to obliterate him. We both knew it. He was going
to die in little pieces and I would weep beside them over whatever he
had done to Lola&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Then Carl flicked
his forearm and an object hurtled toward me. Even before I saw what
it was, this was the moment I realized I had seriously misread the
situation. Because it didn&rsquo;t matter if I was stronger than
Carl, faster and smarter and better armed, if he could surprise me by
throwing things. The factor I had failed to consider was that I had
never fought anyone in my whole life. I had almost hit a girl in
elementary school, but before I could decide to do it, she pushed me
over. That was the extent of my hand-to-hand combat experience. Carl
was trained to physically overpower people.

<p>And he had a car
battery; he had <em>stocked up</em>. It tumbled toward me and I
flinched away. My gun-arm spat bullets into the ceiling, tearing out
concrete. The battery ricocheted off my metal hip, and I thought,
<em>Wait a minute, that didn&rsquo;t even hurt</em>, then the second
hit me square in the back and I screamed, because some of that was
flesh. I staggered in a circle, and then Carl was on top of me, his
sledgehammer arms coming at me like buildings, and I had already
lost.</p>
