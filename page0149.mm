<h5>CHAPTER 
THIRTY-ONE</h5>
<p>I stopped feeling
sorry for myself when I got off the table and saw the man on the
tiles. He was sitting slumped against the far wall, his green
surgical scrubs speckled dark down the front. His lips were very red.
When he saw me, he blinked once, very slowly.</p>
<p>I was seven feet
tall, wearing titanium legs. I had a reactor in my abdomen. When I
had swung my legs off the table, they had moved soundlessly, and when
the hooves touched the floor some tiny part of them fired into the
floor and locked with a click. That was new. When I turned, my torso
swiveled in six ring-like sections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you
okay?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; I already had a
feeling the answer was <em>nothing</em>. If our positions were
reversed, maybe this guy could help me: cut me open, find whichever
internal organs were crushed or torn. Except I wasn&rsquo;t sure I
still had much in the way of internal organs. Not biological ones, at
least. If I was in this guy&rsquo;s position, I would need a
mechanic. So maybe neither of us could help the other. All I knew was
suddenly it didn&rsquo;t seem so bad to be metal.</p>
