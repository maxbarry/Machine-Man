<h5>CHAPTER 
TWENTY-SEVEN</h5>
<p>Lola frowned at the
bedroom door. She hadn&rsquo;t figured it out yet: that Angelica was
evicting us, via Better Future. I struggled to my feet. My poles, I
mean. A standing position. I got upright. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m
saying. &ldquo;Where does Angelica keep her car keys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her car
keys.&rdquo; I managed a step, then another, and made it to the
kitchen doorway. &ldquo;In here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you
want Angelica&rsquo;s car keys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a
difficult question to answer without elevating Lola&rsquo;s heart
rate. And elevating Lola&rsquo;s heart rate would be bad. It would
mean an electromagnetic pulse, a dead car, and no easy way out of

<p>Lola was staring at
me. &ldquo;You want the welder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Oh!
No. I don&rsquo;t want the welder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angelica was
right.&rdquo; She squeezed closed her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so
stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lola!&rdquo;
I shouted. Her eyes popped open. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to walk
past the welder and get in the car. Come see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just come to
the car,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Please. Now.&rdquo;</p>
