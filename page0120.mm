<p>On the third day,
Lola entered my room. Until this, she had been leaving trays of food
outside. I had learned to wait until her footsteps receded, then pull
myself to the door and drag in the food before the dogs descended. I
would shut the door in their little faces and chew, alone.</p>
<p>But this day she
opened the door. It was a small shock, seeing another human. She wore
a green blouse and an air of hopelessness. She looked at me and her
eyes glimmered. I was sitting on the carpet, surrounded by my parts.
Well, parts of my parts. I had disassembled my legs and hand and
arranged them in concentric circles, radiating out. It looked as if I
had suffered the world&rsquo;s neatest explosion. Which I had. The
electromagnetic pulse that had come out of Lola had hurt no-one but
me. It had done nothing but fry half the circuits in a hundred-foot
radius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want...&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I think...&rdquo;</p>
<p>These disassembled
components, that didn&rsquo;t mean I was fixing them. I had taken the
Contours apart because I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything else. I was
trying to break my problem into pieces until it was small enough to
handle. That was how you solved anything: you divided it. I was
clinging to the hope of eventually reaching something fixable.</p>
<p>Lola said, &ldquo;I
think it&rsquo;s really unfair of you to say this is my fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not your fault.&rdquo; I did not look at her as I said this, because
I did not really believe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They put it
in me.&rdquo; She took one step closer, on the narrow, component-free
path between the door and me. Her foot came down beside a three-foot
long section of titanium that had once controlled my plane
stabilization. This was part of my problem: there were big sections
that were machine-welded. I couldn&rsquo;t open them up. &ldquo;They
put that thing in my chest and didn&rsquo;t even <em>tell</em> me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I almost didn&rsquo;t
say it. Then I did. &ldquo;You could have calmed down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could have
calmed down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried,
Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie. I
<em>tried</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I picked up a
radial bolt. I wasn&rsquo;t even sure where this had come from. I had
made notes, in the beginning. I should have kept that up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I notice
people are very selective about their bodies,&rdquo; I told the bolt.
&ldquo;Any time their body does something good, they claim it. They
look good, they play football, they run a marathon, it&rsquo;s <em>I</em>
did this. But something goes wrong, it&rsquo;s not <em>I</em> any more.
It&rsquo;s a problem with their foot. Their brain needs more sleep.
Suddenly it&rsquo;s not <em>them</em>. It&rsquo;s the body they&rsquo;re
stuck in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you
saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
I turned the bolt over in my hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just making an
observation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence. The door
closed with a <em>click</em>.</p>
