<p>The Hummer came at
me and I kicked it. You know that expression, <em>When all you have is
a hammer, everything looks like a nail?</em> Well, I had a hammer. I
had a double-action titanium hammer, and I was starting to see a lot
of nails.</p>
<p>The Hummer went up
on two wheels. The other two passed over my head. The car went a good
ten yards, teetering on the brink of tipping over, as if it were in
the circus. It sailed toward the building and I realized that the
driver faced two mutually exclusive objectives: to bring the car down
onto four wheels and to not ram a ground-floor meeting room. This was
really an either-or decision, but the driver tried valiantly to
accomplish both. The Hummer hit the building at a thirty degree angle
and disappeared halfway inside.</p>
<p>From one
perspective, I can&rsquo;t take much credit for this. It wasn&rsquo;t
like I had anything much to do with that kick: my input was pretty
much limited to cowering in the bucket seat and being very clear in
my mind that I did not want to be run over. The Contours took care of
the rest: the way one leg braced against the ground, the timing of
the swing to catch the Hummer at the right point, the delivery of the
perfect amount of force. But then, that was my code. I had written it
weeks earlier, but the fact remained I had told them what to do in
situations like this. So from this perspective, I was just as
responsible for my legs as anyone else&mdash;more so&mdash;and I had
just kicked over a car. I felt a tidal wave of pride, and confidence,
and I looked up, chose a balcony, and jumped.</p>
