<p>&ldquo;Carl came to
us,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get that clear.
We didn&rsquo;t go around asking employees to chop off their arms. He
knocked on my door one day and asked if we could make him like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She folded her
hands and rested them neatly on one knee. So far Cassandra Cautery
was being very calm. There was no yelling or screaming, no rants
about how much trouble I had caused by kicking their CEO out a window
and running off. So clearly I was missing something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The problem,
Charlie, is we&rsquo;re an engineering-heavy company. I suggest
cutting short a prototyping stage and everybody starts jumping up and
down, telling me it&rsquo;ll be a disaster. But a man volunteers to
have his arms replaced, nobody sees a problem. It&rsquo;s a mentality
you guys have, and I&rsquo;m including you in this group, Charlie,
that the whole world can be divided into hard science and
hocus-pocus. That nothing&rsquo;s significant until it can be
quantified. We needed psychologists, but we got them far too late
because we&rsquo;re full of engineers, and engineers think
psychologists are basically witch doctors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say
anything. She was right. Psychologists are witch doctors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, Carl
went under the knife. And he came out of it fine. Happy, even. We
gave him those, you know, little arms to practice on. He kept asking
for bigger ones, but I knew you&rsquo;d have a problem with that,
Charlie, so I held off. Then, of course, you found him and hit the
roof. Asked me to quote get rid of him unquote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Fire</em>
him. I meant <em>fire</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t
look like you meant fire. You looked like you wanted him dead. But
let&rsquo;s not get into a thing, Charlie, because, to be perfectly
honest, it&rsquo;s pretty cold either way. I decided I couldn&rsquo;t
do that to Carl. Nor to the company, because the kind of legal
liability that would have opened up, I don&rsquo;t even want to
think. So I hid him from you. But of course we had to take away his
arms, and he didn&rsquo;t like that. He didn&rsquo;t like that at
all. We made him a new pair as fast as we could&mdash;your team was
pretty good at that by then&mdash;but...&rdquo; She pursed her lips.
&ldquo;Well, like I said, we were light on psychologists. You recall
the Manager mentioning the problems we were having with the test
subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um...&rdquo;
That wasn&rsquo;t my standout memory from that meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depression.
Stress. Psychotic breaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Carl&rsquo;s
nuts,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And we haven&rsquo;t been able to
contain him.&rdquo;</p>
