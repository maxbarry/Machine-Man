<p>&ldquo;Carl came to
us,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;I want that clear. We
didn&rsquo;t go around asking our employees to chop off their arms.
He knocked on my door one day and asked if I could make him like
you.&rdquo; She flicked a device out from somewhere, read the screen,
then made it disappear again. &ldquo;The problem, Charlie, is we&rsquo;re
an engineering-heavy company. I suggest cutting short a prototyping
stage and everybody starts jumping up and down, telling me why it&rsquo;ll
be a disaster. But a man volunteers to have his arms removed, nobody
sees a problem. It&rsquo;s a mentality you guys have, and I&rsquo;m
including you in this, Charlie, that nothing&rsquo;s significant
unless you can quantify it. You divide the whole world into the hard
sciences and hocus-pocus. What we needed were psychologists, but we
got them far too late because we&rsquo;re full of engineers, and
engineers think psychologists are basically witch doctors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say
anything. She was right. Psychologists are witch doctors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, Carl
went under the knife. And he came out of it fine. Seemed happy, even.
We gave him those, you know, little arms to practice on. He kept
asking for bigger ones, but I knew you&rsquo;d have a problem with
that, Charlie, so I held off. Then, of course, you found him and hit
the roof, asked me to quote get rid of him unquote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Fire</em>
him. I meant <em>fire</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t
look like you meant fire. You looked like you wanted him dead. But
let&rsquo;s not get into a thing, Charlie, because, to be perfectly
honest, it&rsquo;s pretty cold either way. I decided I wouldn&rsquo;t
do that to Carl. Nor to the company, because the kind of legal
liability that would have opened up, I don&rsquo;t even want to
think. So I hid him. But of course we had to take away his arms, and
he didn&rsquo;t like that. He didn&rsquo;t like that at all. We made
him a new pair as fast as we could&mdash;your team was pretty good at
that by then&mdash;but...&rdquo; She pursed her lips. &ldquo;Well,
like I said, we should have had psychologists. You recall the Manager
mentioning the problems we were having with test subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remembered him
telling me they had secretly implanted a weapon in Lola. I remembered
kicking him out a window. Everything else was a little fuzzy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depression.
Stress. Psychotic breaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
Now I remembered. &ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Carl&rsquo;s
nuts,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And we haven&rsquo;t been able to
contain him.&rdquo;</p>
