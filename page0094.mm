<p>: they liked
concrete. I had already been moving fast, but now they really started
pumping. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Near the sidewalk
they slipped, 
</p>
<p>and another bullet
snapped by, so maybe this was fortunate. 
</p>
<p>They slipped once,
near the sidewalk, although this might have been fortunate, because I
was otherwise moving in a predictable straight line. A very fast
predictable straight line, 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Through eyes
blurring with tears, I saw each leg stretch out in front of me, drive
a hoof into the sidewalk, and throw me forward.

NOTES.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I once did one of
those personality tests.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; OK: The
Manager says they&rsquo;re interested in making super soldiers. He
says Lola&rsquo;s got an EMP in her chest. Explains how it works. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;
I want to end here with Charlie busting the fuck out, don&rsquo;t I?
I think so. I think Charlie says he&rsquo;s got to get back to Lola,
and the Manager says Lola is taken care of. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;
I think the Manager should make it very clear to Charlie that there&rsquo;s
only one way out here. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;
Charlie leaps out through the drapes. They protect him from shattered
glass. Then he grabs Lola and they run off. I think he cleans out the
Repo of parts, too. Maybe some guards shoot at him. It&rsquo;s a cool
action scene. Come up with some unusual things. And remember Charlie
is not tough. He&rsquo;s a smart guy afraid for his life with some
kick ass legs. &gt;&gt;</p>
