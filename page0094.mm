<h5>CHAPTER 
TWENTY</h5>
<p>I consider myself a
logical person. I don&rsquo;t play the lottery. I don&rsquo;t care
what my horoscope says. I like movies, but when the love interest
ignores explicit instructions and calls home to let her mother know
she&rsquo;s okay and that&rsquo;s how the bad guys track them down,
that drives me nuts. I think most things about the world could be
improved if people thought a little more about what they&rsquo;re
doing. When someone gets upset with their computer because it won&rsquo;t
do what they want, I usually side with the computer. I believe art is
generally overrated, and things like bridges underrated. In fact, I
don&rsquo;t understand why bridges <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> art. It seems
like they&rsquo;re being penalized for having a use. If I made a
bridge that ended in mid-air, that would be a sculpture, right? But
place it between two land masses and have it ferry two hundred
thousand cars per day and it&rsquo;s infrastructure. That makes no
sense.</p>
<p>I mention this
because some of what I did next was not very logical. And I know if I
heard about it from somebody else, I would lose a little respect for
that person. I would think: <em>Well that&rsquo;s just inadequate
planning</em>. So I want to say in my defense that I accept that
argument, even agree with it, but if you were using nuclear-powered
legs to kick your way through a high-technology facility while armed
security personnel tried to kill you, you might screw up here and
there, too.</p>
