<h5>CHAPTER 
TWENTY</h5>
<p>I consider myself a
logical person. I don&rsquo;t play the lottery. I don&rsquo;t care
what my horoscope says. I like movies, but get frustrated at how the
love interest ignores explicit instructions and calls home just to
let her mother know she&rsquo;s okay, and that&rsquo;s how the bad
guys track them down. I think almost everything wrong in the world
could be fixed if people thought a little more about what they&rsquo;re
doing. I believe art is generally overrated, except for things like
bridges. Bridges are really underappreciated. When someone gets upset
with their computer because it won&rsquo;t do what they want, I
secretly side with the computer.</p>
<p>I mention this
because some of what I did next was not very logical. And I know if I
was hearing about this from somebody else, I would lose a little
respect for that person. I would think: <em>Well that&rsquo;s just
inadequate planning</em>. So I just want to say, in my defense, that
that&rsquo;s a fair call, but if you were using fission-powered
titanium legs to kick your way through a high-technology facility
while highly trained security personnel tried to kill you, you might
make a few odd decisions, too.</p>
