<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re
calling these the Contour Threes.&rdquo; Cassandra Cautery gestured,
like a model on a game show. Only instead of a car or a set of steak
knives it was a pair of black titanium legs with cloven hooves. My
throat constricted, because it was like my old legs had come back to
life. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask what happened to Mark Two. The Threes
are basically a revision of the original Contours, upgraded for
strength and with an improved tactile interface. Oh, and there are
some bug fixes. Did you know the Contours couldn&rsquo;t handle
stairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I unclogged my
throat. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Well,
that would have been useful to know before our Model Two tester ended
up at the bottom of a stairwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to wheel
myself forward, and was reminded that I only had one hand. The lab
assistant came to my rescue, sliding me within touching range. There
were a lot of parts around me here in the Repository, parts on
shelves and parts in foam packing, parts under tantalizingly
translucent sheets of plastic, but right now I couldn&rsquo;t take my
eyes off the Contours.</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;I
think I want to put these on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;There is just one tiny issue.&rdquo;</p>
