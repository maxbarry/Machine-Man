<h5>CHAPTER  EIGHT</h5>
<p>I realized that meeting Lola Banks was not going to be easy when I
exited the Better Future elevator and a security guard fell into step
beside me, muttering into his lapel mike. By the time I reached the
lobby, there were four of them, and another two moving to block the
glass doors. Carl was there, of course. Carl was everywhere. &ldquo;Can
I help you, Dr. Neumann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My legs were already detouring around him, and it was few moments
before I could persuade them to stop. They were a little fiesty. But
finally I came to a juddering halt. Quiet fell. The receptionist had
vanished, I noticed. The entire lobby had emptied, but for me and the
guards. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where would you like to go, sir? We&rsquo;ll escort you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s kind of you, Carl,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But I
have my own transport, thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes slipped to my legs. The Contours were beneath my jeans, but
they were longer than my old legs, and I hadn&rsquo;t been able to
quite pull my socks over a six-inch strip of gleaming titanium. On
the plus side, I was really tall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, sir. But I
must insist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought: <em>I should just walk out of here</em>. Because it wasn&rsquo;t
like they could stop me. I honestly didn&rsquo;t mean to express this
as a mental instruction, of the kind the Contours were supposed to
pick up. But, as I mentioned, they were fiesty. And suddenly they
were moving so quickly I had to grip the sides of the bucket seat to
stay on. &ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; I said. Carl lunged at me like a
linebacker. The Contours stepped around him and ran at the lobby
doors. These did not open in time, which caused the
collision-detection software to stop me so suddenly that my forehead
cracked against the smoked glass. That really hurt. I would have to
fix that. Then the gap between the doors grew wide enough and the
Contours took off. It felt like sitting on a jackhammer. Wind tore at
my face. The sun hurt my eyes. No-one shot at me, though. That was
good.</p>
