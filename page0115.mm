<p>Lola stood beside
me in Angelica&rsquo;s bathroom, brushing her teeth. I was thinking
about my legs. About how they definitely, absolutely could not
possess consciousness. Because that just wasn&rsquo;t possible. I
would believe my legs could think for themselves only when I opened
them up to find them powered by tiny elves. You didn&rsquo;t combine
a bunch of inert materials and get personality. You just didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And yet. There was
something going on here. Some glitch I hadn&rsquo;t anticipated.</p>
<p>A subtle, invisible
tugging brought me out of my thoughts. I looked at Lola in the mirror
and she was looking at me. &ldquo;Mrph,&rdquo; I said, around the
toothbrush.</p>
<p>Lola leaned forward
and spat. &ldquo;I was thinking. We could pull that mattress off
Harrison&rsquo;s bed and lie it on the floor. Then I could sleep next
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harrison was
Angelica&rsquo;s son. He visited two weekends per month. Lola had
told me this earlier, her eyes shimmering with tragedy and outrage,
before launching into a long, painful story of people I didn&rsquo;t
know doing things I was supposed to care about. I have trouble with
these kinds of stories because they contain no useful information. I
mean, I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that Rod was an uncaring bastard who
prioritized his own career over Angelica&rsquo;s, but I don&rsquo;t
know Rod. I&rsquo;m never going to meet him. I don&rsquo;t understand
what I&rsquo;m expected to do about this.</p>
<p>I smiled through
toothpaste. &ldquo;Mmm.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
been so crazy.&rdquo; Lola&rsquo;s voice dropped. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t
had a chance to... get to know each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I leaned forward to
spit into the sink. Then I frowned, because the Contours weren&rsquo;t
helping. They were rigid, when I wanted them to tilt. I tried again:
nothing.</p>
<p>Lola&rsquo;s
fingers addressed a wrinkle on my shirt. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve
earned a chance to relax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thought whispered
inside my brain: the Contours did not like Lola. They did not want
her touching me. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,
Charlie... you <em>really</em> need to relax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was silly. It
couldn&rsquo;t be true. But my thought was: Lola was making them
jealous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;
Lola&rsquo;s fingers entwined mine. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
