<p>That night Lola
slept in the kid&rsquo;s bedroom with me. The kid, apparently, was
Angelica&rsquo;s son, who visited two weekends per month. When Lola
told me this, her eyes shimmered with tragedy and outrage, and soon I
was deep in a long, painful story full of people I didn&rsquo;t know
doing things I was supposed to care about. I have trouble with these
kinds of stories because they contain no useful information. I guess
I&rsquo;m sorry that Rod was a cold, uncaring bastard who prioritized
his own career over Angelica&rsquo;s, but I don&rsquo;t know Rod. I&rsquo;m
never going to meet him. I don&rsquo;t understand what I&rsquo;m
expected to do with this information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could
pull the mattress off that bed,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;And put it
next to my mat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a
mat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
camping mat. I slept on it last night. But I can bring it in here so
we can sleep next to each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smiled. Lola
smiled. Then an odd thought popped into my head. The thought was that
Lola and I should not be having this conversation in front of the
Contours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
been so crazy.&rdquo; Lola&rsquo;s voice dropped an octave. &ldquo;We
still haven&rsquo;t had a chance to... get to know each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;
A crazy panic blossomed inside my brain: that Lola was making the
Contours jealous. I had no grounds for this. I wasn&rsquo;t even
prepared to grant that the Contours possessed any kind of
consciousness, despite recent evidence. But I felt suddenly, insanely
sure that they were getting mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I figure the
kid&rsquo;s mattress is perfect for you,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;Your
legs can just lie on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We pulled the
mattress off the kid&rsquo;s bed and lay it beside an unrolled
camping mat. The mat was for Lola, because there was more of her that
required cushioning. I could happily sleep standing up, given a wall
to lean against...</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Lola snuggled
against me. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Maybe Lola
starts playing with him, he feels uncomfortable bc of the Contours
(watching him). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Maybe Lola
</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
actually quite difficult for me to lie down,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of
the legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola went silent.
She was not saying: <em>You should take them off, then.</em></p>
