<p>A nurse wheeled me out of the hospital to the limo waiting outside.
On my lap was a ziplock bag full of medicines. This was a little
superfluous, given the facilities we had at Better Future, but I
didn&rsquo;t complain. You don&rsquo;t say no to a bag full of drugs.
Even I knew that.</p>
<p>Carl, the security guard who hated me, stood beside the limo&rsquo;s
open door, his hands folded. I don&rsquo;t know why the company kept
assigning me Carl. It wasn&rsquo;t like we didn&rsquo;t have other
security personnel. Carl saw us coming but didn&rsquo;t move. He
would probably stand there impassively while I tried to claw and
heave my way into the limo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for taking care of me,&rdquo; I said to the nurse. &ldquo;I
use the word <em>care</em> loosely.&rdquo; I hadn&rsquo;t meant to
bitch. I was misdirecting my annoyance at Carl. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope we never
see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We reached the limo. Carl bent down and scooped me up. I had maligned
him unfairly. I felt bad. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; I said to the nurse. &ldquo;I
want to explain something. I know you think I&rsquo;m mentally ill.
But I didn&rsquo;t crush my leg for no reason. I did it because I
have prosthetics that are faster, stronger, and generally superior to
biological limbs in every way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her lips parted in surprise. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
<em>unfair</em>.&rdquo;</p>
