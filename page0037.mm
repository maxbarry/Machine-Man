<p>On the sidewalk below me, the mother yanked her son&rsquo;s arm. This
kid was no toddler: he was seven or eight. I have seen women
wrestling with children of this age before, in supermarket aisles and
parking lots, and usually the kids don&rsquo;t budge. But apparently
a man plummeting out of the sky changed everything, because this kid
flew through the air like he was hollow. It was a convincing example
of the strength-boosting properties of adrenaline.</p>
<p>My legs could not correct my flight path, and thus were forced to
abandon their original plan to use the boy and his mother as shock
absorbers. I impacted the sidewalk ten inches from them. The concrete
split beneath my feet. Dust burst into the air. My spine bent in a
way that felt very, very wrong. I lost my breath and sucked in a
lungful of dust. I felt the Contours moving beneath me, and tried to
tell them to wait a second, because I had to apologize to the mother,
and check she and her son were okay, and so was I. But the legs
didn&rsquo;t care. Their world was defined by a location, a
destination, and the optimum path between the two; everything else
was a waste of time. I was pretty sure now they were going to kill
me.</p>
