<p>I followed Lola
down the corridor to Angelica&rsquo;s kid&rsquo;s bedroom. As I did,
I became increasingly nervous that the Contours were about to kick
Lola in the back. Because, without having anything to back this up, I
knew they hated her. But we made it to the room without incident, and
Lola closed the door. Her arms snaked around my waist. Her face
tilted upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;Just a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angelica is
right down the hall. These walls look thin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola reached up,
took hold of my face, and pulled it toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you
really think this is a good&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> Our lips met. I
forgot all about self-aware legs. All I cared about was getting
closer to Lola. Then I realized I <em>was</em> getting closer to Lola.
That invisible attractive force was rising again, dragging my metal
parts toward her heart. Lola&rsquo;s eyes sprung open. &ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo;
Her hands pushed against me. &ldquo;Charlie!&rdquo; Then it broke,
and she stumbled backward. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I abruptly
remembered what Cassandra Cautery had said, back at Better Future:
<em>You had to go and excite Miss Banks.</em> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your
heart. It happens when your heart beats fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
She clutched at her chest. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever
they put in there is activating when your heart rate rises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola&rsquo;s mouth
dropped open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Wait.
Don&rsquo;t get scared,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That will make it
worse.&rdquo;</p>
