<p>Carl walked us to a
supply elevator and swiped his ID card. I found this interesting,
because a moment ago, Carl&rsquo;s hands had looked like blocks of
stone. Now they split into two thick fingers, supple enough to grasp
the tag around his neck. It seemed they could separate into at least
four digits, then come together to deliver a punching force. That
wasn&rsquo;t a bad idea, for security guard hands. It&rsquo;s what I
would have done, if I&rsquo;d designed them. Which I hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This opens
in the parkling lot,&rdquo; Carl said. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re on
your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola and I shuffled
inside. Lola said, &ldquo;Thank you, Carl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not doing you a favor. I&rsquo;m paying my debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,
thanks,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And, Carl, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevators doors
began to close, but Carl raised a hand to send them back. His fist
was a block of solid metal again. &ldquo;Pardon me, Dr. Neumann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I&rsquo;m
sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you
sorry for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For telling
them you wanted me thrown out? Is that what you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or do you
mean you&rsquo;re sorry for asking them to take away my prosthetic
arms? Is that what you mean? For ordering that nobody be allowed to
use your parts but you? That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re talking about?
Making them leave me in a bed with a button to push with my foot when
I needed someone to help me go to the bathroom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No apology
is necessary, Dr. Neumann.&rdquo; Carl lowered his arm, releasing the
elevator door. I heard the thin whine of servo-magnetics. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
in the past. I have my own parts now.&rdquo;</p>
