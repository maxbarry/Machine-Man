<p>Carl walked Lola
and me to a supply elevator and swiped his ID card. I found this
interesting, because a moment ago, Carl&rsquo;s hands had looked like
blocks of stone. Now they split into two thick fingers, supple enough
to grasp the tag around his neck. It seemed they could separate into
at least four digits, then come together to deliver a punching force.
That wasn&rsquo;t a bad idea, for security guard hands. It&rsquo;s
what I would have done, if I&rsquo;d designed them. Which I hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This opens
in the parking lot,&rdquo; Carl said. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re on
your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola and I shuffled
inside. Lola said, &ldquo;Thank you, Carl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not doing you a favor. I&rsquo;m paying my debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,
thanks,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And, Carl, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevators doors
began to close, but Carl raised a hand to send them back. His fist
was a block of solid metal again. &ldquo;Pardon me, Dr. Neumann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I&rsquo;m
sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you
sorry for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For asking
them to get rid of me? Is that what you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For making
them take away my prosthetic arms, because you didn&rsquo;t want
nobody to use your parts but you? That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re
talking about? That time I spent in a bed with a button to push with
my foot when I needed someone to help me go to the bathroom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
in the past, Dr. Neumann.&rdquo; Carl lowered his arm, releasing the
elevator door. I heard the thin whine of servo-magnetics. &ldquo;I
have my own parts now.&rdquo;</p>
