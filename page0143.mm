<p>The ceiling of this
section of Better Future was a checkerboard. Every second check
glowed. I had never appreciated how pretty this was, until I was
pushed along beneath it on a steel gurney. &ldquo;These lights are
really neat,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we get
him on the gas?&rdquo; This was Cassandra Cautery. She was walking
alongside my gurney, accumulating lab assistants and other people I
had never seen before. &ldquo;We have a time pressure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
She glanced down at me. &ldquo;Almost there, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Lola is
meeting us at the operating theater?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you
sure?&rdquo; I was feeling light-headed. I hadn&rsquo;t had any
drugs. It was the imminent prospect of parts. &ldquo;You really mean
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;in a short while, you are going to be the fastest,
strongest man on the planet. I wouldn&rsquo;t lie to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gas here.&rdquo;
A man raised a mask. &ldquo;Head forward, Dr. Neumann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Lola.&rdquo;
The mask was strapped around my face. I heard a hiss. &ldquo;What
about Lola?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll
be here to hold your hand,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;Uh.
Bad choice of words. But she&rsquo;ll be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear on
my sister&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We passed through a
doorway. The soft checkerboard glow-squares were replaced with harsh
surgical lights. I raised my head and saw a lot of people in green
surgical gowns. They looked very fuzzy. Fuzzy and warm. I lay back,
because my head was getting heavy.</p>
<p>We stopped moving.
I closed my eyes. Someone squeezed my hand. I felt this from a
distance, as if it wasn&rsquo;t my hand at all. &ldquo;Charlie?&rdquo;
I didn&rsquo;t feel like answering. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; said
Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take it all off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>...&gt;&gt;&ldquo;How
much are we doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take it all off.&rdquo;</p>
