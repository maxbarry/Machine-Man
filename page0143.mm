<p>The ceiling of this
section of Better Future was a checkerboard. The light-colored
squares were actually lights: they glowed uniformly, as bright in the
corners as the middle. I had never appreciated how pretty this was,
until I lay on a gurney and watched them pass over my head. &ldquo;These
lights are really neat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we get
him on the gas?&rdquo; This was Cassandra Cautery, walking alongside.
Several other people were also walking alongside: we had been
accumulating them since we left the Repository. &ldquo;We have a time
pressure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;And
Lola will meet us at the operating theater, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you
sure?&rdquo; I was feeling very light-headed. I hadn&rsquo;t had any
drugs. It was the imminent prospect of parts. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not
just saying that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie, in
a short while you will be the most physically powerful human being on
the planet. I wouldn&rsquo;t lie to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gas here.&rdquo;
A mask approached. &ldquo;Head forward, Dr. Neumann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you make
a call?&rdquo; Hands took hold of my head. The mask snapped around my
mouth and nose, muffling my words. &ldquo;Can you make sure Lola will
be there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear on
my sister&rsquo;s life. She&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We passed through a
doorway. The glowing checkerboard vanished, and was replaced with
stark white plaster and surgical lights. I raised my head and saw a
great many people in green surgical gowns. They looked fuzzy. Fuzzy
and warm. I lay back, because my head was getting heavy. Then, on
impulse, I raised it again. I was under a thin sheet, but I could see
the familiar shape of my torso, my arms. I smiled a little, and
closed my eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s
out,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Okay. Go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard a rustling
of material. A click, then an electric saw, quite loud, like someone
was testing it: <em>vnnnn, vnnnn</em>. A man said, &ldquo;How much are
we doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo;
said Cassandra Cautery. That was the last thing I heard.</p>
