<p>Carl punched me in
the guts and I staggered backward and sat down on the hood of a car.
The surprising thing about this was the lack of force. It was more
like I saw the blow coming and tried to ride what I expected to be a
massive transfer of momentum. But it wasn&rsquo;t, and I realized
something: compared to me, Carl&rsquo;s arms were not very strong. Of
course they weren&rsquo;t: he had biological legs. Even allowing for
some hidden bracing beneath his uniform, there was no way he was
carrying around half-ton arms. They would do some damage if I let
them near my soft parts. But he couldn&rsquo;t pick me up and throw
me around. He could barely push me.</p>

<p>They were
lightweight.

<p>I swung my gun-arm
in a long, slow loop, aimed at Carl&rsquo;s head. It was ridiculous:
I already knew he was too close.

If we see Lola is okay, we LOSE THE RAGE. MUST NOT SEE THAT LOLA IS
OKAY. &gt;&gt;</p>

The thing is, Carl shouldn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s being tracked&mdash;at
least, not by Charlie. He should expect BF to come after him&mdash;that&rsquo;s
why he&rsquo;s trying to dig out the locator&mdash;but Charlie is a
surprise. However, he has heard Charlie coming up the ramp. Charlie
has called out. Lola has called back. Lola would think: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
run to Charlie!&rdquo; Carl would say: &ldquo;Wait, it&rsquo;s not
safe, think of his parts.&rdquo; &ldquo;We have to get this tracker
off as fast as possible.&rdquo; &gt;&gt;</p>
