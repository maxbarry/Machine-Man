<p>Carl punched me in
the stomach and I staggered backward and sat down on the hood of a
car. Its windscreen imploded. The surprising thing about this was the
lack of force. It was more like I saw the blow coming and tried to
ride what I expected to be a massive transfer of momentum, but
wasn&rsquo;t. I realized that compared to me, Carl&rsquo;s arms were
not very strong. Of course they weren&rsquo;t: he had biological
legs. Even allowing for hidden bracing beneath his uniform, there was
no way he was carrying around half-ton arms. I didn&rsquo;t want to
let them near my face. But he wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to pick
me up. He could barely push me.</p>
<p>I got off the car
and swung my gun-arm. I was so late doing this that Carl not only had
time to deflect it with his arm but first gave me a patronizing look.
I tried to back up, to put enough distance between us to employ the
useful part of my gun-arm, but he came after me, looking pained.
&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Calm down a second.&rdquo; My
heels hit the car behind me and pushed it up the retaining wall. I
tried to raise the gun-arm and again Carl knocked it aside. &ldquo;Listen
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>No</em>,
I thought, or my parts did; it was hard to tell. My gun roared, and
the air filled with concrete dust. I coughed and lost sight of Carl.
I tried to back up and the car behind shrieked twisted metal and
broken glass. I tried to kick it out of the way, flinging a hoof
backwards, and all of a sudden there was much less resistance than I
had anticipated. It wasn&rsquo;t until a little later that I realized
I had kicked the car completely over the edge of the concrete
retaining wall, and it was tumbling end-over-end to the alley below.
At the time, all I knew I was falling.</p>
