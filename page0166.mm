<p>Carl punched me in
the stomach. I staggered backward and sat down on the hood of a car.
Its windscreen imploded. The surprising thing about this was the
weakness of Carl&rsquo;s punch. I had seen the blow coming and tried
to ride what I expected to be a massive transfer of momentum, but
wasn&rsquo;t. Sitting on the hood of a red sports car, I realized
that compared to me, Carl&rsquo;s arms were not very strong. Of
course they weren&rsquo;t: he had organic legs. There was no way he
could carry around my kind of hardware. I didn&rsquo;t want to let
him get those things near my face, but they weren&rsquo;t solid
enough to punch through titanium. He couldn&rsquo;t pick me up and
throw me. He could barely push me.</p>
<p>I got off the car
and swung at him. I did this so slowly that Carl not only had time to
deflect it with his arm but first give me a patronizing look. My rage
blossomed. I backed up, trying to put enough distance between us to
use my gun-arm to insert a lot more metal into Carl than he already
had. My heels hit the same car again, and it screamed, metal on
concrete, folding up against the low retaining wall behind me. I
raised my gun-arm. Carl knocked it aside again.</p>
<p><em>No</em>,
I thought, or my parts did; one or the other. I kept backing up, the
car behind me popping glass and cracking metal, and suddenly there
was a lot less resistance than there had been. I staggered backward.
A gap opened between me and Carl and I squeezed fury through my arm.
As my gun-arm roared, Carl ducked and punched it upward. Chunks of
ceiling rained around me. The air filled with dense, choking dust. I
was still walking backward, flailing and off-balance, and I
discovered the reason that the car was no longer holding me up was
that I had pushed it completely over the retaining wall, sending it
tumbling end-over-end to the alley below, and the way I discovered
this was that all of a sudden so was I.</p>
