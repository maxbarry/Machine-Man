<p>I lay still while the fMRI machine
thrummed around me. At first this was unsettling, because I had to
lie back and poke my head into a small hole in a large machine. The
issue is the hole looks like a mouth. Then there&rsquo;s the noise,
and it&rsquo;s hard to forget the unit is generating enough magnetic
force to pull a pin clean through your body. But after a while, the
<em>whoomp-whoomp-whoomp</em> became comfortingly rhythmic. I felt I
was in a womb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said a
disembodied voice. Jason, my lab assistant. &ldquo;Now regret.
Something you wish you could change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought a moment. &ldquo;An uncle of
mine died from colon cancer. I was about twelve. I remember thinking
how ridiculous it was, a failure in one small body part killing the
whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had figured that as long as I was
here, I might as well map the whole brain. That would come in handy
later. Also, if things went like I planned, it would soon be
difficult to MRI myself non-fatally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Dr. Neumann, I&rsquo;m
not seeing it. Can you try again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, okay. One time in junior
high, I didn&rsquo;t go to a school dance because I thought nobody
would want to go with me, then afterward, I heard this girl I liked
really wished that I&rsquo;d asked her.&rdquo; Isabelle. She had been
good at chess. Always under-developed her rooks, though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still not definitive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I almost said: <em>Let&rsquo;s skip
regret</em>. Because, really, what
good was it? It was like guilt; effective at promoting social
behavior amongst tribe members, but not great for the individual. I
mean, in an ideal world, everyone would feel guilty about treating
<em>you</em> unfairly, but
you&rsquo;d be able to cheat your grandmother and get a solid night&rsquo;s
sleep. I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s a great set of values. I&rsquo;m
just saying, logically, that&rsquo;s what would work best for you.
It&rsquo;s not coincidence that every well-paid person I&rsquo;ve
ever met seems to possess an abnormally low guilt-regret index, is my
point. Not that I&rsquo;m an expert on social behavior. But I have
spent some time around Better Future managers, and I would like to
plot that data set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a
kid in the cafeteria the other day,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He told me
he admired my work. And I didn&rsquo;t know what to say. He was just
excited, but I kind of brushed him off. I wanted to say something.
Like, you know, thanks. I wish I&rsquo;d been able to say something
to that kid. Because he&rsquo;s probably a lot like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence.
&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s as close as we&rsquo;re going to get,&rdquo;
Jason said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try happy.&rdquo;</p>
