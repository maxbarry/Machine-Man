<p>I lay still while the fMRI machine
thrummed around me. If you haven&rsquo;t experienced this, I
recommend it. At first it&rsquo;s unsettling, because they ask you to
lie back and poke your head into a small hole in a very large
machine. The issue is the hole looks like a mouth. Then, of course,
there&rsquo;s the noise, and it&rsquo;s hard to forget it&rsquo;s
generating enough magnetic force to pull a pin clean through your
body. But after a while, the <em>whoomp-whoomp-whoomp</em> becomes
comfortingly rhythmic, like being in a womb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said a
disembodied voice. It was Jason, my lab assistant, on speaker. &ldquo;Now
regret. Something you wish you could change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I figured as long as I was here, I
might as well map the whole brain. It would come in handy later.
Also, if things went like I planned, it would soon be very difficult
to take all the metal out of my body. &ldquo;An uncle of mine died
from colon cancer. I was about twelve. That upset me. I remember
thinking, how ridiculous that a failure of one body part kills the
whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence. &ldquo;Sorry. I&rsquo;m
not seeing anything. Can you try again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I considered. &ldquo;One time in junior
high, I didn&rsquo;t go to a school dance because I thought nobody
would want to go with me, then afterward, I heard this girl I liked
really wished that I&rsquo;d asked her.&rdquo; Isabelle. She had been
quite good at chess. Always left her rooks stranded, though. &ldquo;How
was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not definitive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I almost said: <em>Let&rsquo;s skip
regret</em>. Because, honestly, how
useful was it? It was like guilt: sure, from an evolutionary
standpoint, you wanted to encourage social behavior amongst
tribe members. But it wasn&rsquo;t great for any individual in
particular. In an ideal world,
everyone would feel guilty about treating you unfairly, but you&rsquo;d
be able to screw over whomever you liked and have a solid night&rsquo;s
sleep. I&rsquo;m not saying I wanted to be that person. That person
is an asshole. I&rsquo;m just saying the reason we think he&rsquo;s
an asshole is our brains have been imprinted with millennia-old ideas
about tribal loyalty. And those ideas, I&rsquo;m not sure they still
apply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a
kid in the cafeteria the other day,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He told me
he admired my work. And I didn&rsquo;t know what to say. I didn&rsquo;t
even think it was possible for people to admire me, until recently,
so he took me by surprise. And this kid, he was just excited, but I
kind of brushed him off. I didn&rsquo;t mean to. I wanted to say
something. I don&rsquo;t know. Something like, you know, thanks, and
I&rsquo;m not a dick. But I couldn&rsquo;t think. I never can, in
situations like that. I wish I&rsquo;d been able to say something to
that kid.&rdquo; I fell silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo;
Jason said. &ldquo;Now do happy.&rdquo;</p>
