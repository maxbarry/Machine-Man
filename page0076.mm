<p>I lay very still while the fMRI machine
thrummed around me. If you haven&rsquo;t experienced this, I
recommend it. It&rsquo;s a little alarming at first, because you&rsquo;re
lying back with your head stuck inside a room-sized machine
generating enough magnetic force to pull a pin clean through your
body. But then you settle into the rythmic <em>whoomp-whoomp-whoomp</em>
and it begins to feel womb-like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said a
disembodied voice. It was Jason, my lab assistant. &ldquo;Now regret.
Something you wish you could change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had decided that as long as I was
here, I might as well map the whole brain. That would come in handy
later. Also, if things went like I planned, it would soon be very
difficult to take all the metal out of my body. &ldquo;An uncle of
mine died from colon cancer,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That upset me. I
remember thinking, how ridiculous that a problem in one part of a
body kills the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence. &ldquo;Something else?&rdquo;
Jason said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really seeing anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I considered. &ldquo;Okay, one time in
junior high, I didn&rsquo;t go to a school dance because I thought
nobody would want to go with me, then afterward, I heard this girl I
liked wished that I&rsquo;d asked her.&rdquo; Isabelle. She had been
quite good at chess. Always failed to develop her rooks, though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry. Still nothing
definitive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I opened my mouth to say, <em>Let&rsquo;s
just skip regret</em>. Because,
honestly, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly a useful emotion. I wasn&rsquo;t
sure I wanted to keep that anyway. Then I thought of something. &ldquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Charlie is
sorry about: Lola losing her heart. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>&rdquo;</p>
<p>I waited. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo;
Jason said. &ldquo;Now happy.&rdquo;</p>
