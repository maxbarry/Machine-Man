<p>&lt;&lt; Maybe move the heart thing
here, so the prev one can be a Friday? &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>This guilt, I knew what it was. More to
the point, I knew where it was. It was in my brain&rsquo;s
ventromedial prefrontal cortex. And I was pretty sure I could take it
out.</p>

<p>or a second I thought Carl was in the
room. I sat up and checked the time. I had been asleep for ten
minutes.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> He would not be needing any parts.</p>

<p>I levered the Contours onto the bed.
This was harder than it sounds, because of the weight. But it beat
scrambling around for them in the middle of the night, when the
phantom pain hit. When I finished, I lay back and closed my eyes. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>But Carl came crawling into my mind. I
couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about him. I fell asleep and woke up
drenched in sweat, my chest feeling like someone was sitting on it.
For a second I thought Carl was in the room. I sat up and checked the
time. I had been asleep for ten minutes.</p>
<p>I slept in half-hour snatches. At three
a.m., I couldn&rsquo;t bear it any longer. This guilt was
intolerable. I had to fix it. I began to inch the Contours off the
bed.

<p></p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about
Carl. I felt as if someone were gently squeezing my chest. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>from a dream of Carl trapped inside the
Clamp.

<p>&ldquo;Well.&rdquo; She leaned back and
spread her arms across the back of the sofa. &ldquo;How would you
like me to fix it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come
here. Sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can. I know your legs,
Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was right: I could sit, if for some
reason I felt the urge to collapse backward. But it seemed a silly
thing to do when I was comfortably seated in the Contours&rsquo;
harness.</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery patted the sofa
beside her. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be a social thing. I

<p>It was not easy. I essentially had to
perform a controlled fall. The sofa caught me with a <em>whoof</em>,
then creaked alarmingly until I shuffled down far enough to
shift off most of the Contours weight.</p>
<p>Cassandra put her hand on my thigh.
This registered as a kind of non-specific tingling, like standing
outside before a thunderclap. The Contours didn&rsquo;t have much in
the way of pressure sensors down there. &ldquo;Charlie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fix this. I want you
to know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t say anything. But
still, I felt comforted.</p>
