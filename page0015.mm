lobby while Lola Banks had the inside of her mouth swabbed and
answered questions in a harshly lit room about everyone she had ever

it could also tell you if you had cancer. Usually this was a
two-minute procedure, but when Lola stepped out she was re-buttoning
her blouse and two hours had elapsed.</p>
