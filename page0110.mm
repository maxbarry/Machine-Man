<p>&ldquo;Toast?&rdquo;
said Lola. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s peanut butter. I could make you
peanut butter toast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I grunted. On TV, a
nurse with amazing cleavage stared out a window. Behind her, a
handsome doctor in a white coat told her she would never get away
with this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;Yes or no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
had enough coffee.&rdquo; She came out of the kitchen. I was standing
in the middle of the living room, watching TV. To make enough room, I
had pushed the sofa out of the way with my foot. It now sat against
the wall, occupied by three aggrieved dogs. One wore a little faux
leather jacket. I really, really hoped that dog was not supposed to
be Elvis. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you have some water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want water.&rdquo; The TV doctor wrapped the nurse into a passionate
embrace. That was an unexpected development.</p>
<p>Lola came over.
&ldquo;Charlie, I know you&rsquo;re grouchy, coming off the
painkillers. But you should have some water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water won&rsquo;t
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gestured at my
bandaged arm. &ldquo;Will it help this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angelica
said it was just a scratch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s
infected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola fell silent.
&ldquo;Well, Angelica will look at it tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelica had gone
to work. She would, allegedly, bring home as many painkillers as she
could safely swipe from the hospital. In the meantime, I had to
survive on over-the-counter medication. It was a serious come-down
from what I was used to. Every yap from the dressed-up rats that
roamed Angelica&rsquo;s house was like a knife in my brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
make you toast,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m bringing you
more water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went back out
to the kitchen. She was right: I <em>was</em> grouchy. But not just
because of the painkillers. I was mad that she and Angelica had taken
me out of my legs. I didn&rsquo;t voice this. I knew Lola would just
say that I&rsquo;d passed out and the Contours were too heavy to
lift. And this was undeniable. She had logic on her side. But it
didn&rsquo;t change how I felt.</p>
