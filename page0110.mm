<p>&ldquo;Toast?&rdquo;
said Lola. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s peanut butter. I could make you
peanut butter toast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I grunted. On TV, a
nurse with amazing cleavage stared out a window. The handsome doctor
in a white coat behind her, she said, would never get away with this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;Yes or no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
had enough coffee.&rdquo; She came out of the kitchen. I was standing
in the middle of the living room, watching TV. To make room, I had
pushed the sofa out of the way with my hoof. It now sat against the
wall, occupied by three aggrieved dogs. One wore a little faux
leather jacket. I really, really hoped that dog was not supposed to
be Elvis. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you have some water instead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want water.&rdquo; The TV doctor wrapped the nurse into a passionate
embrace. That was an unexpected development.</p>
<p>Lola came over.
&ldquo;Charlie, I know you&rsquo;re grouchy, coming off the
painkillers. But you should have some water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water won&rsquo;t
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gestured at my
bandaged arm. &ldquo;Will it help this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angelica
said that was just a scratch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s
infected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola fell silent.
&ldquo;Well, Angelica will look at it tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelica had gone
to work. She would, allegedly, be bringing home as many painkillers
as she could safely swipe from the hospital. In the meantime, I had
to survive on over-the-counter medication. It was a serious come-down
from the level of medication I was used to. Each yap from the
dressed-up rats roaming Angelica&rsquo;s house was a knife in my
brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
make you toast,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m bringing you
more water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went back out
to the kitchen. She was right: I was grouchy. But not just because of
the painkillers. I was mad that she and Angelica had taken me out of
my legs. I didn&rsquo;t voice this. I knew Lola would point out that
I&rsquo;d been unconscious and the Contours were too heavy to lift.
And this was undeniable. She had logic on her side. But it didn&rsquo;t
change how I felt: that she had taken my parts.</p>
