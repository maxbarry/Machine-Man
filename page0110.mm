<p>&ldquo;Toast?&rdquo;
said Lola. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s peanut butter. I could make you
peanut butter toast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I grunted. On TV, a
nurse with amazing cleavage stared out a window. Behind her, a
dashingly handsome doctor told her she would never get away with
this. &ldquo;Coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
had a lot of coffee already.&rdquo; Lola came over to where I was
standing on the living room rug. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you have some
water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want water.&rdquo; The TV doctor wrapped the nurse into a passionate
embrace and kissed her. That was an unexpected development.</p>
<p>She took my arm.
&ldquo;Charlie, it&rsquo;s okay to be grouchy. I know you&rsquo;re
coming down off the painkillers. But have some water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water won&rsquo;t
help.&rdquo; I gestured at the bandage on my bicep. &ldquo;It really
hurts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angelica
said it was just a scratch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s
infected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola fell silent.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what Angelica says when she gets home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelica had gone
to work. Allegedly she would be bringing home as many painkillers as
she could safely swipe from the hospital. In the meantime, I had to
survive on over-the-counter medication. Angelica&rsquo;s tiny dogs
roamed the house like rats. Each yap was like a knife in my brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
make you that toast,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m bringing
you some water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I watched her walk
to the kitchen. She was right: I <em>was</em> grouchy because of coming
off the painkillers. It was the first time in months I&rsquo;d gone
more than 24 hours without serious medication. But I was also mad
that she had taken me out of my legs. I didn&rsquo;t voice this. I
knew Lola would counter with the fact that I had passed out, and the
Contours were too heavy to lift. She had logic on her side. But it
didn&rsquo;t change how I felt.</p>
