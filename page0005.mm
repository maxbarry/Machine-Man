<p>I am not a people
person. I don&rsquo;t know why. Maybe you can figure it out and let
me know. All I know is any time I&rsquo;m evaluated, I score very low
on social metrics. Also, if there is a party, I&rsquo;m not invited.
Or if I am, the people I&rsquo;m seated between will both talk to the
person on their other side. There&rsquo;s something about me that is
repulsive. I don&rsquo;t mean <em>disgusting</em>. I mean like magnets.
The closer people get to me, the stronger their urge to move away.</p>
<p>I am a smart guy. I
recycle. Once I found a lost cat in the city and caught it and took
it to the cat home. Sometimes I make jokes. I can tell what&rsquo;s
wrong with your car just by listening to it. I think women are
beautiful and can do anything they put their minds to. I like kids,
except the ones who are rude to their parents and the parents just
stand there, smiling. I have a steady job. I own my own apartment. I
don&rsquo;t lie. These are qualities I keep hearing people like. I
can only think there must be some other ingredient that no-one is
letting on, something vital, because I have no friends, am estranged
from my family, and haven&rsquo;t dated this decade. There is a guy
in Lab Control who once killed a woman with his car, and he gets
invited to parties. I don&rsquo;t understand that.</p>
