<p>I am not a people
person. I don&rsquo;t know why. Maybe you can figure it out and let
me know. All I know is that any time I am evaluated, I score very low
on social metrics. Also, if there is a party, I am not invited. Or if
I am, and I&rsquo;m seated between people, they will both talk to the
person on their other side. There is something about me that repels
people. Well, maybe not <em>repels</em>: that bores them. People look
at me and know I am a waste of their time.</p>
<p>I am a smart guy. I
am good and conscientious and sometimes funny. These are qualities I
keep hearing are desirable. I can only think there must be some other
vital ingredient that no-one is letting on, because I have no
friends, don&rsquo;t speak to my family, and my last date was in high
school. There is a guy in Media Control who once killed a woman with
his car, and he gets invited to parties. I don&rsquo;t understand
that.</p>
