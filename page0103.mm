<p>At some point we
stopped. It wasn&rsquo;t until Lola climbed down off me that I saw
where: a leafy, suburban street. It looked odd, like something from a
TV show, and then I realized and laughed. I had lived here, as a boy.
I felt touched: I had asked the Contours to bear me and Lola
somewhere safe, and they had brought me back to my childhood. I felt
like hugging them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
said Lola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lived in
that house once. When I was a kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. You have
blood on your chin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to wipe it
with my sleeve, but that had blood on it, too, probably from my
bicep. This struck me as funny, too, because I was some kind of crack
fighting machine. I had just outrun a whole bunch of security
guards&mdash;in fact, I had done that twice&mdash;and in between, I
had jumped eighty feet into the air and kicked a car. I sniggered,
then started laughing. Lola stared at me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.
It&rsquo;s just... we got away. I actually rescued you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re
different,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>I stopped.
&ldquo;Different how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged.
&ldquo;Confident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
more confident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of
the legs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo;
said Lola. &ldquo;I guess when you go leaping all over the place and
kicking people, I guess you get confident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confidence
is a good thing, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo; She looked away. &ldquo;I liked you before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt stung. I
didn&rsquo;t deserve that. I had just saved her life, probably. She
was just pissed at me because of Carl. So I let it go. We had more
pressing issues to discuss, like where we were going to spend the
night. But the feeling settled into my gut: Lola didn&rsquo;t
understand me, and my legs did.</p>
