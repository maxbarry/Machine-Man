<p>At some point we
stopped. It wasn&rsquo;t until Lola climbed down off me that I saw
where: a leafy, suburban street. It looked odd, like something from a
TV show. Then I realized where I knew it from, and laughed. I had
lived here, as a boy. I felt touched: I had asked the Contours to
bear me somewhere safe, and they had brought me back to my childhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
said Lola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lived here
once. When I was a kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She studied me.
&ldquo;You have blood on your chin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to wipe it
with my sleeve, but that had blood on it, too, probably from my
bicep. This struck me as funny, too, because it was like I was some
kind of crack fighting machine. I had just outrun a whole bunch of
security guards&mdash;twice, actually&mdash;and in between, I had
jumped through the air and kicked a car. I sniggered, and it
ballooned into laughter. Lola stared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. It&rsquo;s
just... we got away. I actually rescued you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re
different,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>I stopped.
&ldquo;Different how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged.
&ldquo;Confident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
getting confident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of
the legs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo;
said Lola. &ldquo;I guess when you go leaping all over the place and
kicking people, I guess you get confident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
a good thing, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo; She looked away. &ldquo;I liked you before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt stung. I
didn&rsquo;t deserve that. I had just saved her life, probably. She
was just pissed at me because of Carl. So I let it go. We had other
issues to discuss, like where we were going to spend the night. But
the feeling nagged at me: that Lola didn&rsquo;t understand me, and
my legs did.</p>
