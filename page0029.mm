<h5>CHAPTER  SEVEN</h5>
<p>A nurse wheeled me out of the hospital to the limo waiting outside.
On my lap was a ziplock bag full of medicines. This was a little
superfluous, given the facilities we had at Better Future, but I
didn&rsquo;t complain. You don&rsquo;t say no to a bag full of drugs.
Even I knew that.</p>
<p>Carl, the security guard who hated me, stood beside the limo&rsquo;s
open door, his hands folded. I don&rsquo;t know why the company kept
assigning me Carl. It wasn&rsquo;t like we didn&rsquo;t have other
security personnel. Carl saw us coming but didn&rsquo;t move. He
would probably stand there impassively while I clawed and heaved
myself into the limo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for taking care of me,&rdquo; I said to the nurse. &ldquo;I
use the word <em>care</em> loosely.&rdquo; I hadn&rsquo;t meant to
snipe. I was misdirecting my annoyance at Carl. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope we never
see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carl bent down and scooped me up. I had maligned him unfairly.
&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; I said to the nurse. &ldquo;Let me explain
something. I didn&rsquo;t crush my leg because I hate myself. I did
it because I have access to prosthetics that are faster, stronger,
and all-round superior to biological parts.&rdquo; I saw surprise
spread across her face. &ldquo;You see? It&rsquo;s not mental
illness. It&rsquo;s just logical self-improvement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her expression hardened. It was like she hated me more than ever.
&ldquo;Well, that is unfair,&rdquo; she said.</p>
