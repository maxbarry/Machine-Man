<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
Lola said. &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked in a
circle around my prototype leg three times. She stopped beside the
die stamp that had crushed my old one, although she didn&rsquo;t know
that. It was gleaming clean and humming on standby. You couldn&rsquo;t
leave that caliber of machinery idle just because some idiot managed
to lose a limb in it. It was expensive as all get-out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That
looks heavy,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
about 180 pounds,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;It tends to dent the
floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do
you lift it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.
It walks by itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola looked at
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that
tripod wheel at the base? That rotates. There&rsquo;s always some
part of it touching the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh. And
what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; She pointed at a squat black box,
protruding from one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The
processor.&rdquo; I rubbed my chin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really happy
with the positioning. It&rsquo;s a little vulnerable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does
it do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. You
know. Basic monitoring and control. GPS. Data storage. Wi-fi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She blinked.
&ldquo;Your leg has wi-fi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of
course. Otherwise it couldn&rsquo;t interface with Google Maps for
optimum path-finding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola looked at
me blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Basic
encapsulation,&rdquo; I explained.
&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t need to keep telling your leg where to
step. You should tell it where you want to go, and let it figure out
how to get you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked back
at the leg. I don&rsquo;t think she really understood encapsulation.
But she liked it. She squatted, reached out, and touched it.</p>
<p>I cleared my
throat. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her fingers ran
over the chrome. They caressed the plastic. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
most beautiful thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt myself
flushing. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
