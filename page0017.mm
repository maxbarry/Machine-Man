<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
Lola said. &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked in a
circle around my prototype leg three times. She stopped beside the
die stamp that had crushed my old one, although she didn&rsquo;t know
that. It was gleaming clean and humming on standby. You couldn&rsquo;t
leave that caliber of machinery idle just because some idiot managed
to lose a limb in it. It was expensive as all get-out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That
looks heavy,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
about 180 pounds,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;It tends to dent the
floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do
you lift it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.
It walks by itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola looked at
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that
tripod wheel at the base? That rotates. There&rsquo;s always some
part of it touching the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh.&rdquo;
She crept closer to it. Then she squatted, reached out, and touched
it.</p>
<p>I cleared my
throat. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran her
fingers down the chrome. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most beautiful thing
I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt myself
flushing. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
