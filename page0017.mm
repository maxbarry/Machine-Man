<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
Lola said. &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked in a
circle around my prototype leg three times. She stopped beside the
Clamp, the big pre-fab die stamp that had crushed my old leg,
although she didn&rsquo;t know that. The Clamp was gleaming clean.
You didn&rsquo;t leave machinery of that caliber idle just because
some idiot managed to lose a limb in it. It was expensive as all
get-out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks
heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
about 180 pounds,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;It tends to dent the
floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do
you lift it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.
It walks by itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola looked at
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The foot
rotates. It&rsquo;s essentially an orbital wheel, on a shifting
multi-dimensional axis.&rdquo; I wanted to tell her its top speed,
but didn&rsquo;t, because she&rsquo;d think I was boasting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And
what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; She pointed at a squat black box, which
protruded from one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. The
processor. I&rsquo;m not really happy with the positioning on that.
It&rsquo;s a little vulnerable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does
it do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know.
Basic monitoring and control. GPS. Data storage. Wi-fi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your leg
has wi-fi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has
to. Otherwise it couldn&rsquo;t interface with the online
path-finding API.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola&rsquo;s
eyes rose to mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t need to keep telling your leg where to
step. You should tell it where you want to go and let it calculate
how to get you there. That&rsquo;s basic encapsulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola looked back
at the leg. I don&rsquo;t think she really understood encapsulation.
But she was impressed with my leg. She knelt on the floor before it.
The leg was under a lab spotlight, looking a little like a steel
vase. It bulged at the bottom, because the foot was the size of a
backpack, and tapered to a slimmer thigh. My lab assistants had
performed excellent work in metals fab this week. I had never seen
them so motivated.</p>
<p>Lola reached out
and touched the leg. I cleared my throat. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her fingers ran
down the metal. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most beautiful thing I&rsquo;ve
ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a moment
before I could speak. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; I said.</p>
