<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
Lola said. &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked in a
circle around my prototype leg three times. She stopped beside the
Clamp, the big pre-fab die stamp that had crushed my old leg,
although she didn&rsquo;t know that. The Clamp was gleaming clean.
You didn&rsquo;t leave machinery of that caliber idle just because
some idiot managed to lose a limb in it. It was expensive as all
get-out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That
looks heavy,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
about 180 pounds,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;It tends to dent the
floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do
you lift it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.
It walks by itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola looked at
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That base
rotates. It&rsquo;s essentially a wheel, on a shifting
multi-dimensional axis.&rdquo; I wanted to tell her its top speed,
but didn&rsquo;t, in case she thought I was showing off</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh. And
what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; She pointed at a squat black box,
protruding from one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The
processor. I&rsquo;m not really happy with the positioning on that.
It&rsquo;s a little vulnerable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does
it do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. You
know. Basic monitoring and control. GPS. Data storage. Wi-fi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your leg
has wi-fi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of
course. Otherwise it couldn&rsquo;t interface with the Google Maps
API for path-finding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola looked at
me blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You
shouldn&rsquo;t need to keep telling your leg where to step. You
should tell it where you want to go, and let it figure out how to get
you there. That&rsquo;s basic encapsulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola looked back
at the leg. I don&rsquo;t think she really understood encapsulation.
But she liked my leg. She squatted, reached out, and touched it.</p>
<p>I cleared my
throat. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her fingers ran
over the chrome. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most beautiful thing I&rsquo;ve
ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt myself
flushing. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
