<p>The beautiful
assistant girl led Cassandra Cautery and I to what I can only call a
sitting room. I say this as someone who is not totally sure what a
sitting room is. But imagine something straight from an eighteenth
Century Victorian mansion, with with heavy drapes, busy wallpaper,
and chairs with curving, detailed legs. Turned, I think is the word.
I felt kind of elegant just being here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know who
we&rsquo;re meeting,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery, once the girl had
gently closed the door on us. This was not posed as a question,
although I didn&rsquo;t know the answer. Cautery looked scandalized.
&ldquo;Walter Scour. The Manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The
manager?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The
<em>Manager</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which
manager?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The</em>
Manager,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The Manager. You know. The Manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
his title?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course
not.&rdquo; She began pacing across the rug. &ldquo;His title is
General Manager of Creative Solutions. But he&rsquo;s the Manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a general rule,
I paid no attention to company communications. They only tended to
make me aware of inconvenient obligations. But now Cassandra Cautery
mentioned it, <em>The Manager</em> did sound familiar. A few snippets
of water-cooler gossip surfaced in my mind; lurid stories that ended
with: <em>and that was the last anyone heard of them</em>. That
corporate legend about the labs being flooded with poison gas: that
was supposedly the Manager&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
say anything embarrassing,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;Can
you do that, Charlie? For me?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Creative
Solutions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
Cassandra Cautery dropped into a deep purple chair.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;The
Manager.&rdquo;</p>
