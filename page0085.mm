<p>The beautiful girl
led Cassandra Cautery and I to what I can only call a sitting room. I
say this as someone who is not totally sure what a sitting room is. I
mean something that looked stolen from an 18th Century Victorian
mansion: heavy drapes, busy wallpaper, and chairs with curving,
detailed legs. Turned, I think is the word. I felt elegant just being
here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know who
we&rsquo;re meeting,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery, once the girl had
gently closed the door on us. This was not posed as a question,
although I didn&rsquo;t know the answer. &ldquo;The Manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The
manager?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The</em>
Manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which
manager?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The
Manager,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The Manager. You know. The Manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
his title?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course
not.&rdquo; She began pacing around the chairs. &ldquo;His title is
Chief Executive Officer. But everyone calls him the Manager. Because
that&rsquo;s what he does. He manages. You know when Congress wanted
to shut us down after the Boston VL38s turned out to be not so
non-lethal? Of course you don&rsquo;t. Because he managed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a general rule,
I did not pay attention to company communications. They only made me
aware of inconvenient obligations. But now Cassandra Cautery
mentioned it, <em>The Manager</em> did sound familiar. I think his name
had come up in a few of Jason&rsquo;s lurid stories, the ones he told
to impress other lab assistants. They ended like: <em>and nobody ever
saw them again</em>. &ldquo;The Manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
She slipped one thumbnail into her mouth and began gnawing at it.
&ldquo;The Manager.&rdquo;</p>
