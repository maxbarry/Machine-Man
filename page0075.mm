<p>That
night I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. It wasn&rsquo;t the phantom pain. It
was Carl. He crawled into my mind and I couldn&rsquo;t get him out. I
woke every half-hour, sticky with sweat, trying to escape Carl
as he chased me armlessly through the corridors. One time, he stood
in the Clamp, looking at me as the plates closed in. His eyes said:
<em>How could you do this, Charlie? You know I need some parts</em>.</p>
<p>I sat up, shivering. Carl was a bad
guy, I told myself: he had tried to kill Lola and steal my arms. And
even if that wasn&rsquo;t quite true, he was a destroyer of
relationships. I had seen the look in Lola&rsquo;s eyes, when she&rsquo;d
said: <em>He doesn&rsquo;t have any arms</em>.
Carl was poison.</p>
<p>I had asked Cassandra Cautery to fire
him. That was what I&rsquo;d asked, in her office yesterday. She
nodded once. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of it,&rdquo; she said. I
walked out of that room happy, thinking my problems were solved.</p>
<p>But here I was wracked with guilt. The
guy had no arms. Without my help, he would get, what, hospital
prosthetics? Those were awful. You might as well strap on flippers.</p>
<p>I
groaned. This was unbearable. I had to fix it. As logical as it was
for me to get Carl fired, a part of me knew it was wrong. And that
part was my brain&rsquo;s ventromedial prefrontal cortex. It
was the area responsible for guilt. Well, I was going to do something
about that.</p>
