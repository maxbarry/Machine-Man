<p>That
night I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. It wasn&rsquo;t the phantom pain. It
was Carl. He kept crawling into my mind, and I couldn&rsquo;t get him
out. Every half-hour, I woke up drenched in sweat, my chest
feeling like someone was sitting on it, gasping from dreams of Carl
trapped in the Clamp, or standing at the foot of my bunk with no
arms. In every one, his eyes burned with accusation. <em>How could you
do this, Charlie?</em> said his eyes.
<em>You know I need some parts</em>.</p>
<p>I had asked Cassandra Cautery to fire
him. She had nodded once. &ldquo;Done,&rdquo; she said. That was it.
I had walked out of that room happy, thinking my problems were
solved.</p>
<p>But this guilt was unbearable. I told
myself he deserved it, that he was a bad guy who had shot Lola and
stolen my arms. And that, even if this wasn&rsquo;t all quite true,
he was a destroyer of relationships. I had seen the look in Lola&rsquo;s
eyes. <em>He doesn&rsquo;t have any arms</em>.
Carl was poison. I would be crazy <em>not</em>
to get rid of the guy. To have him thrown out onto the street. With
no arms.</p>
<p>I
groaned. I couldn&rsquo;t bear it. I had to fix this. I began
to inch the Contours off the bed. Guilt was hyperactivity of the
brain&rsquo;s ventromedial prefrontal cortex. You could see it on
fMRI scans. I was pretty sure I could locate mine. Then I could take
it out.</p>
