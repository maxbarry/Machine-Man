<p>&ldquo;The first thing I&rsquo;d like
to lay on the table,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery when the elevator
doors had closed, &ldquo;just so it&rsquo;s out there, is that we&rsquo;ve
made a fairly significant investment in Lola Banks. That life-saving
operation did not come cheap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The life-saving operation she
needed after Carl shot her,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
one you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes remained fixed on the floor
numbers ticking over on the elevator panel screen. &ldquo;The second
thing is we&rsquo;ve made a significant investment in <em>you</em>. In
providing the resources you need, to do what you want to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in
Lola&rsquo;s chest. Something that&rsquo;s not a heart. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie...&rdquo; There was
something odd in her tone: a tightness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to do
the right thing by you. I really have. When you asked me to dispose
of Carl, did I quibble? Did I say, <em>Gee, that&rsquo;s a little
heartless, he&rsquo;s a ten-year employee with no arms?</em>
No. I did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced at me.
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I
asked you to <em>fire</em>
Carl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually,
Charlie, your precise words were <em>get rid of</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated. &ldquo;Of
course it is. But the point is, I&rsquo;ve done my best to make this
a supportive environment for you. I&rsquo;ve sheltered you from the
painful decisions that had to be made. And there have been painful
decisions, Charlie. There have been many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevator doors
opened. We were not on the labs sublevel. We were somewhere else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you had
to go and excite Miss Banks. Well, now I can&rsquo;t shelter you any
more.&rdquo; I realized what that tightness was in Cassandra
Cautery&rsquo;s voice. It was nerves. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re all
going to get a little reality check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could see myself:
on the wall outside the elevator hung a huge, ornate silver mirror.
To one side sat a little table bearing a lamp and a vase of white
flowers; to the other was a life-sized statue of a woman with an
outstretched arm and blank eyes. Some kind of goddess, I am guessing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now
management wants to see us,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;After
you.&rdquo;</p>
