<p>&ldquo;Taken care of.&rdquo; She
smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you wanted, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But
what arms did you give him?</p>
<p>I nodded. &ldquo;Did you give him some
other arms?

NOTES.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Lola asks Charlie for
something. BF won&rsquo;t like it. But he agrees. Then Cass Caut is
pissed. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; They go on
the run because BF wants to kill Lola. And the reason they want to
kill Lola is they put something in her chest, something important,
and if anyone finds out what they did, BF is in a lot of trouble.
It&rsquo;s BF&rsquo;s premiere product. Maybe it makes Lola kind of
immortal. It&rsquo;s incredibly valuable. They&rsquo;ll do anything
to get it back. She&rsquo;s never meant to leave the compound. It&rsquo;s
meant for soldiers who sneak in and EMP enemy installations. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Maybe Lola
is MAGNETIC. If Charlie gets too close to her, he sticks. That&rsquo;s
pretty awesome. Maybe when she gets emotional, something happens. Oh
yeah. Can she pull metal out of the walls, something like that? Maybe
she&rsquo;s an EMP?? Fuck yeah. She gets emotional, she shorts
everything out. That&rsquo;s fucking awesome. Charlie&rsquo;s trying
to bear her away. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited.&rdquo; &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; So Charlie
and Lola are getting to know each other, starting to get hot and
heavy, and he feels drawn to her, as if she is magnetic, then the
phone rings. CC says he&rsquo;s needed at work. She&rsquo;s pissed. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Lola signed
some kind of disclaimer, of course, with hidden clauses. BF is
interested in zombies. Lola is technically a zombie... she&rsquo;s
kept alive by mechanics. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>

<p>&ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come
here. Sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can. I know your legs,
Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was right: I could sit, if for some
reason I felt the urge to collapse backward. But it seemed a silly
thing to do when I was comfortably seated in the Contours&rsquo;
harness.</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery patted the sofa
beside her. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be a social thing. I 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was not easy. I essentially had to
perform a controlled fall. The sofa caught me with a <em>whoof</em>,
then groaned like a ship at sea until I shuffled down to shift
off most of the Contours weight.</p>
<p>Cassandra put her hand on my thigh.
