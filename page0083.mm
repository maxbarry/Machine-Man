<p>&ldquo;The first thing I&rsquo;d like
to lay on the table,&rdquo; Cassandra Cautery said when the elevator
doors had closed, &ldquo;just so it&rsquo;s out there, is that we&rsquo;ve
made a fairly significant investment in Lola Banks. That life-saving
operation did not come cheap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The life-saving operation she
needed after Carl shot her,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
one you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes remained fixed on the floor
numbers ticking over on the elevator panel screen. &ldquo;The second
thing is we&rsquo;ve made a significant investment in <em>you</em>. In
providing the resources you need, to do what you want to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in
Lola&rsquo;s chest. Something that&rsquo;s not a heart. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie, Charlie,&rdquo; she
said, and there was something odd about her tone: a tightness I had
not heard before. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to do the right thing by
you. I really have. When you asked me to dispose of Carl, did I
quibble? Did I say, <em>Gee, that&rsquo;s a little </em><em>heartless,
he&rsquo;s a ten-year employee with no arms?</em>
No. I did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>She glanced at me.
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire
Carl. I asked you to <em>fire</em>
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually,
your exact words were <em>get rid of</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated. &ldquo;Of
course it is. But the point is, I&rsquo;ve tried my hardest to make
this a warm, supportive environment for you. I have sheltered you
from the many painful decisions that had to be made to provide this
environment. And there have been many, Charlie. There have been
many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevator doors
opened. We were not on the labs sublevel. We were somewhere I had
never been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now I
can&rsquo;t shelter you.&rdquo; I finally realized what that
tightness was in Cassandra Cautery&rsquo;s voice. It was nerves. &ldquo;Now
we&rsquo;re all going to have a little reality check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stared at the
wall opposite. On it hung a huge, ornately-framed mirror; to one side
was a little table bearing a lamp and a vase of white flowers, and to
the other was a life-sized statue that may have been some Roman god.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to meet
the boss,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. She gestured. &ldquo;After
you.&rdquo;</p>
