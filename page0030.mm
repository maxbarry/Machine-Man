<p>It was five weeks before I heard from Lola Banks. I tried to call
her, many times. But the hospital was not an authorized number, so I
had to ask reception to connect me, and whenever they did, it rang
out. I began to suspect that reception was being deliberately
obstructive. Finally I jury-rigged a packet-disguised VoIP connection
from my workstation, and sure enough, when I did that, the hospital
switch answered right away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie!&rdquo; said Lola. She sounded robotic, because my
computer was untangling her audio from a data stream that otherwise
looked like a really long joke email. But I heard delight in her
voice, and felt a rush of relief. It had been a month and <em>she</em>
hadn&rsquo;t called <em>me</em>; I had begun to think I must have
kissed her the wrong way, or she&rsquo;d grown embarrassed about it,
or something. I don&rsquo;t know. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been calling and
calling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! They always tell me you&rsquo;re busy and I have to leave
a message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s weird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I called your home. But your answering machine is full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably because I haven&rsquo;t been home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since when?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought about this. &ldquo;March.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence. &ldquo;I think you need to get out of there,
Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I went to scratch my cheek and missed. I looked at
my hand. I wasn&rsquo;t wearing my index finger, that was why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you need to come up for air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well... okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give you an address,&rdquo; Lola said, and
I reached for a pen, with the hand that had fingers.</p>
