<p>Once Carl had left, I strapped on my
fingers and prepared to head to the lab. I took two steps, then
stopped. I had been quite excited about the prospect of returning to
the lab, but now, all of a sudden, I wasn&rsquo;t. I felt like
walking around. Maybe doing some standing. I wanted to rediscover the
sensation of moving without someone pushing me. So I did. And before
I left the Repository, I tipped the wheelchair on its side and
stepped on it.</p>
<p>I walked to the elevators and pushed
the button myself. While I waited, my hands behind my back, I hummed
a little. The elevator doors opened on two white-coated technicians,
who said, &ldquo;Good morning, Dr. Neumann,&rdquo; and moved to make
room for me. &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; I said. I had no idea who they
were.</p>
<p>When, inevitably, I found my way to
Lola&rsquo;s medical room, she was asleep. But the Contours were not
especially quiet, and a few steps into the room, her eyelids
fluttered open. She saw me and smiled. It was a small smile, but very
beautiful, and I thought about this for a long time afterward: this
perfect moment, which could not be improved.</p>
