<h5>CHAPTER 
TEN</h5>
<p>&ldquo;This is really unfortunate,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;I
feel terrible about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t see her. I was having trouble opening my eyes. They
had sedated me, back at the cafe, while I was watching Lola Banks.
While I was transfixed by the opening and closing of her mouth, the
slowly spreading shock and fear on her face, someone had jabbed a
needle in my arm. My veins filled with chemicals as Lola&rsquo;s
fingers described a slow arc through the air, terminating at the deep
red flower that blossomed beneath her yellow dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we need now,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery, &ldquo;is
just to take a few deep breaths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My right eyelid peeled open. My left was still gummed up, but I could
see a blob where her face must be, framed by watery blonde hair.
Beyond that was a nondescript ceiling. I could have been anywhere.
But I wasn&rsquo;t. I was at work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like some water?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I bet
you&rsquo;re thirsty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola had reached for me. I had tried to catch her, but my legs
wouldn&rsquo;t move. They were inert. They were anchors. I strained,
and Lola fell to the floor in front of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s been some miscommunication on both
sides,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;I think there are some
real lessons to be learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Lola</em>, I croaked. Cassandra Cautery leaned closer. I don&rsquo;t
think she heard me. But she knew what I meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s understandable you&rsquo;re upset, Charlie. I&rsquo;d
be upset, in your place. But please bear in mind: this was a
high-pressure situation. Our people were forced into split-second
decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lola.&rdquo; This time it was a real word. My left eye
fluttered open. In a minute, I would be able to sit up. Shortly after
that, I would be able to get my hand around Cassandra Cautery&rsquo;s
tiny neck and squeeze some answers out of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the unknown,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It scares
people. Makes everyone think worst-case. All this could have been
avoided, if only there had been full disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I managed to co-ordinate an arm and levered myself up. I was in a
medical room. It was small and windowless. The walls were a pale,
nostalgic blue. I could smell something acrid and unforgiving, like
detergent. Or maybe that was Cautery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With that in mind,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to
figure out why your girlfriend has a metal heart.&rdquo;</p>
