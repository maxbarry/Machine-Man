<h5>CHAPTER 
ONE</h5>
<p>One Tuesday afternoon my left leg was
severed. It wasn&rsquo;t as bad as it sounds. Well, it was. It was
agonizing. There was a lot of screaming and flopping around and
trying to tear my shirt into pieces to stem the bleeding. While I was
busy with this, my co-workers stared through two-inch polycarbonate
security glass and beat on the door. They couldn&rsquo;t get in. It
was sealed for their safety. I had to apply my own tourniquet and try
not to pass out for eight minutes. While I lay there, waiting for the
time-release, I could see the top of what used to be my leg poking
out from between two thick slabs of steel, gently dripping blood to
the floor. I felt sorry for it. My leg hadn&rsquo;t asked for this.
It had been a good leg. A faithful leg. And now look at it.</p>
<p>But in the weeks afterward, as I lay in
my hospital bed, I came to see the bright side. I remembered that
expression: <em>A setback is just an opportunity in disguise</em>.
I decided that was true. Because while I was sad to lose my leg, now
I could build a better one.</p>
