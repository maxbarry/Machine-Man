<p>I was lying in my
own blood: I could smell it. I raised I had been bleeding for a
while. I should</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I really needed
some clinical detachment. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The amount of blood
coming out of my shoulder suggested I would be dead very soon. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It had not
completed, obviously: I still had fingers. But it had started.
Someone had begun to sever my left arm from my shoulder. They had
almost made it all the way through. From the gash they had left,
blood pumped enthusiastically. I was lying in a pool of it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Panic jolted
through me. This was the kind of wound that killed you, very quickly.
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> It was a method
that had worked well enough in the past. This time, though, I
collapsed halfway through. I looked at my left arm, to see what the
problem was, and saw: 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>An electric saw,
its blade dark with what I could only assume was blood. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>...</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; Finish
with either CC imploring Charlie, you&rsquo;re our only hope, you
need to be top of your game to compete with Carl, or: Show me. I
think Show Me, save the former for the Friday after the pre-req
conversation. And put the crouch there too.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>, because I was
worried that if I did, the delicate porcelien of the world would
shatter and fall to pieces.</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery
crouched in front of me. This seemed unnecessary to me, because it
reversed our height differential without significantly reducing it. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>And not just arms.
We have a pelvis. A lower torso that regulates energy 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Arms.
Pelvis. Torso. We have a range.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; Actually,
the pre-reqs should require it. That&rsquo;d be a good page for
tomorrow. The pre-reqs. &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; This week
I think they maybe prepare for Carl, but he doesn&rsquo;t come. So
then they bulk up a little more. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; The big
story here is Charlie getting new parts. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; soft
sciences: Charlie asks Lola about id. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Id comprises the unorganised
part of the personality structure that contains the basic drives. It
acts according to the pleasure principle, seeking to avoid pain or
unpleasure. </em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A low, keening
noise came out of Lola.

<p>&ldquo;Think of
Better Future as a machine with eight thousand employees. An
artificial intelligence programmed to shift resources around to
generate wealth and power.&rdquo;</p>
