<p>The hardest thing
about cutting off my arm was reaching the saw. I was on an operating
table, it was on the tiles: that was a real problem. I had to strain
and stretch to loop my fingers around its cord. Then, to change my
grip, I had to hold the cord in my teeth. Pull, bite, move hand,
pull. It was a real trial. Then I got the thing up and thumbed on the
power and wished I hadn&rsquo;t been so enterprising. If the cord had
been a little further away, beyond my reach, would that have been
such a bad way to die? I would have been blameless. Even noble.</p>
<p>One time at a mall,
I saw a guy demonstrating an electric carving knife. He had a
steaming roast chicken on a plate, and as I walked by, he showed a
middle-aged couple how easily the knife whirred through the meat,
slicing off delicious strips with a noise like: <em>vrrrreeeee</em>.</p>
<p>For some reason I
expected this to sound different.</p>
