<p>&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; said Jason,
pointing to his monitor. He looked tired. We had been mapping my
brain for six hours. &ldquo;Activity in the ventromedial prefrontal
cortex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I fastened my robe. A small Better
Future logo was stitched on the pocket. &ldquo;This is my guilt
picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded. &ldquo;Looks very
localized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does. Did you look up that
study?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jason clicked. &ldquo;According to
Krajbich et al, patients with damage to that area were significantly
less sensitive to guilt. They actually quantified it. See this table?
Regular people have a guilt quotient of around two hundred. The
patients scored 27. And there&rsquo;s no detectable impact on other
emotions. In all other respects, the patients were normal.&rdquo; He
scrolled down. &ldquo;Oh, wait. Envy&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Envy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually... no, that&rsquo;s
within the margin of error. Probably meaningless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pondered. &ldquo;So if my VMPFC was
suppressed, I could expect to feel less guilty, but otherwise the
same as now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot less guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;A
lot less guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure how you&rsquo;d
suppress it, though,&rdquo; Jason said. &ldquo;I mean, without
injecting tetrodotoxin into your brain. Or actually cutting it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An awkward silence fell. I remembered I
had crushed my right leg in front of Jason. He had tried to stop me.
We had never really talked about that. &ldquo;Do you think there&rsquo;s
an ethical problem with that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jason looked at his monitor. &ldquo;What
do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it.&rdquo;</p>
