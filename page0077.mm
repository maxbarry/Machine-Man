<p>&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; said Jason,
pointing to his monitor. He looked tired, because we had been mapping
my brain for six hours. I think his shift ended some time ago.
&ldquo;Activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lowered the Contours. It felt good to
get back into them, after all that time naked. It felt really good.
&ldquo;This is my guilt picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Looks very localized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does. Did you find that
study?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jason clicked his computer mouse.
&ldquo;Okay. According to Krajbich et al, patients with VMPFC damage
are significantly less sensitive to guilt. They actually quantified
it. Regular people have a guilt quotient of around two hundred. The
test group scored 27.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded. &ldquo;And they were
otherwise fine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct. No significant
differences noted in any other emotion. Oh. Wait. Envy&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Envy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jason peered at the screen. &ldquo;Actually,
no, that&rsquo;s within the margin of error. Probably meaningless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So if my VMPFC was suppressed, I
could expect to feel less guilty, but otherwise the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot less guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;A
lot less guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
sure how you&rsquo;d suppress it, though. I mean, without actually
cutting it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An awkward silence fell. I remembered I
had crushed my right leg in front of Jason. He had tried to stop me.
We had never really talked about that. &ldquo;I suppose that would be
kind of drastic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of irreversible,&rdquo;
Jason said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although I wouldn&rsquo;t regret
it.&rdquo; This was a joke. Jason stared at me. &ldquo;Because of the
lack of a  ventromedial prefrontal cortex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. I see what you mean.&rdquo;
He did not laugh.</p>
<p>I tried again. &ldquo;This is what
people aspire to, isn&rsquo;t it? A life lived without regret? That&rsquo;s
a saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the idea there is you
should behave in a manner that would not cause regret in a reasonable
person. Not that you should surgically excise the capacity for regret
from your brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pondered this. Jason may have had a
point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some great things we
can do with computer modeling,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Or if you want
to leap ahead to mice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about a <em>helmet</em>?&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;With fixed needles, each capable of delivering a
measured dose of tetrodotoxin to various areas of the brain. Press a
button, bam, take out the VMPFC.&rdquo; I gestured to the screen. &ldquo;Or
whatever area needs suppressing for a few hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not just tetrodotoxin.
Adenosine, for alertness. Any chemical you need, ready for delivery
in the right spot at the right time. <em>That&rsquo;s</em>
interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine walking around in that
helmet.&rdquo; I groped around the desk for a pen. &ldquo;I need to
write this down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I should call Cassandra
Cautery,&rdquo; said Jason.</p>
