<p>&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; said Jason,
pointing to his monitor. He looked tired, because we had been mapping
my brain for six hours. &ldquo;Activity in the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lowered the Contours. It felt good to
be in them again, after all that time naked. It felt really good.
&ldquo;This is guilt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Looks very localized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does. Did you find that
study?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jason clicked his computer mouse.
&ldquo;According to Krajbich et al, patients with VMPFC damage are
quantifiably less sensitive to guilt. Regular people have a guilt
quotient of around two hundred. The VMPFC-impaired group scored 27.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And were otherwise fine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct. No significant
differences noted in any other emotion.&rdquo; Jason peered at the
screen. &ldquo;Oh. Wait. Envy&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Envy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually... that&rsquo;s within
the margin of error. Probably meaningless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. So if my VMPFC was
suppressed, I would expect to feel less guilty, but otherwise the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot less guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;A
lot less guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jason glanced at me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not sure how you&rsquo;d suppress it, though. I mean... without
actually... cutting it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An awkward silence descended. I
remembered I had crushed my right leg in front of Jason. He had tried
to stop me. We had never really talked about that. &ldquo;I suppose
that would be kind of drastic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of irreversible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although I wouldn&rsquo;t regret
it.&rdquo; This was a joke. Jason stared at me. &ldquo;Because of the
lack of a ventromedial prefrontal cortex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. I see what you mean.&rdquo;
He did not laugh.</p>
<p>I tried again. &ldquo;This is what
people aspire to, isn&rsquo;t it? A life lived without regret? That&rsquo;s
a saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; Jason said. &ldquo;I
think the message there is you should behave in a manner that would
not cause regret in a reasonable person. Not that you should
surgically excise the capacity for regret from your brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pondered this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Neumann, there are some
really great things we can do with computer modeling. Or if you want
to leap ahead to mice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about a <em>helmet</em>,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;With fixed needles, each capable of delivering a
measured dose of tetrodotoxin to various areas of the brain. Press a
button, bam, take out the VMPFC.&rdquo; I gestured to the screen. &ldquo;Or
whatever area needs suppressing for a few hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not just tetrodotoxin.
Adenosine, for alertness. Any chemical you need, primed for delivery
in the right spot at the right time. <em>That&rsquo;s</em>
interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine walking around in that
helmet.&rdquo; I groped around the desk for a pen. &ldquo;I should
write this down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I should call Cassandra
Cautery,&rdquo; said Jason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <em>helmet</em>,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great idea.&rdquo;</p>
