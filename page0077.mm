<p> Jason sounded a little tired. We had
been at this for two hours.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Moving on,&rdquo; said Jason.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy,&rdquo; said a disembodied
voice. &ldquo;Something you&rsquo;re looking forward to.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; said Jason.
He pointed to a computer monitor. Of all my lab assistants, Jason...</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was about five in the morning, but
he hadn&rsquo;t complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s guilt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s activity in the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex,&rdquo; Jason said. &ldquo;Which the
literature suggest is highly correlated with guilt, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let&rsquo;s say we were to
take the ventromedial prefrontal cortex out of the picture. What
would we expect to happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppress it. Drug it. Cut it
out. Something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; Jason said. He
clicked his mouse. &ldquo;Well, according to Krajbich et al, you
would become less sensitive to guilt, while leaving your other social
functions unaffected. They did some experiments with patients
suffering from VMPFC damage, asked them to play social trust and
betrayal games. The patients tended to donate less, betray other
players more often, and prioritize their self-interest higher. Those
are activities implied by lesser feelings of guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The results are quite startling.
They were actually able to quantify guilt. Look at this. See the
control group? Regular people have a guilt score of 202. The VMPFC
patients scored 27.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all other emotions were
unaffected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it says.&rdquo;
He leaned closer. &ldquo;Oh. Wait. Envy. Envy&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Envy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, no, that&rsquo;s
within the margin of error,&rdquo; Jason said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
probably just a statistical fluke.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think there&rsquo;s an
ethical problem with this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jason looked at his monitor. &ldquo;What
do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If I remembered right, guilt was highly
localized there. You could see it on scans. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you go,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Your arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I touched them, etc. &ldquo;What about
Carl? What arms did you give him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assume you didn&rsquo;t push
him out the door with no arms,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Did you take him
to a clinic or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery was silent a moment.
&ldquo;You remember, Charlie, we had a discussion about what to do
with Carl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I said,
irritated. &ldquo;And I asked you to fire him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t say <em>fire</em>.
You said <em>get rid of</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo;
said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;Yeah. I know. Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;So where&rsquo;s Carl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taken care of,&rdquo; said
Cassandra Cautery.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Taken care of.&rdquo; She
smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you wanted, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But
what arms did you give him?</p>
<p>I nodded. &ldquo;Did you give him some
other arms? 
</p>

NOTES.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; He&rsquo;s mad at Lola. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come
here. Sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can. I know your legs,
Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was right: I could sit, if for some
reason I felt the urge to collapse backward. But it seemed a silly
thing to do when I was comfortably seated in the Contours&rsquo;
harness.</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery patted the sofa
beside her. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be a social thing. I 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was not easy. I essentially had to
perform a controlled fall. The sofa caught me with a <em>whoof</em>,
then groaned like a ship at sea until I shuffled down to shift
off most of the Contours weight.</p>
<p>Cassandra put her hand on my thigh. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The brain&rsquo;s home of guilt. I was
going to pay mine a visit, and shut that fucker down.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Guilt registered there; you could see
it on fMRI scans. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>That was guilt&rsquo;s home in the
brain. 
</p>
<p>Guilt registered there as hyperactivity</p>
<p>That was where guilt localized in the
brain. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You could see it on fMRI scans. I was
pretty sure I could locate mine. Then I could remove it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As logical as it
was 
</p>
<p>I began to inch the Contours off the
bed. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Guilt was hyperactivity of the

<p>What if Lola found out? 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I thought about Lola,  all I could
see were her eyes. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>all I could see were her eyes, swimming
with confusion and 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>My brain was set on torturing me and it
was immune to logic. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>But this guilt was unbearable. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I
would be crazy <em>not</em> to
get rid of the guy. To not throw him out onto the street. With no
arms.</p>
