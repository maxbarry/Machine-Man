<h5>CHAPTER 
THIRTY-FIVE</h5>
<p>&ldquo;Lola!&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;Oh Lola, I thought you were move out of the way.&rdquo;
The last part of this sentence surprised me. That hadn&rsquo;t been
what I meant to say. &ldquo;I thought you were dead. I thought Carl
killed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shot
him,&rdquo; she said. It was true. I could see Carl better now, and
he was a mess. He must have used those metal arms to try to defend
himself, because they were battered and torn, but not effectively
enough, because so was a lot of his upper torso. His eyes glittered
in the darkness. <em>Don&rsquo;t
relax!</em> said my parts.
<em>He&rsquo;s sneaky.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here.&rdquo;
I held out my arm to Lola, the one that didn&rsquo;t carry
ammunition. &ldquo;Move away from him. He&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s
not dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <em>is</em>.&rdquo;
My legs stepped forward. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been running around trying
to kill me. He essentially blew up Better Future, and he kidnapped
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
said Lola. &ldquo;He rescued me.&rdquo;</p>
