<h5>CHAPTER 
THIRTY-FIVE</h5>
<p>&ldquo;Lola! Oh,
Lola, Lola, I thought you were move out of the way.&rdquo; The end of
this sentence surprised me. That wasn&rsquo;t what I had meant to
say. &ldquo;I thought you were dead. I thought Carl killed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shot
him,&rdquo; Lola said. It was true. I could see Carl a little better
now, and he must have used those metal arms to try to defend himself,
because they were battered and torn, but not effectively enough,
because so was a lot of his torso. His eyes glittered in the dark.
<em>Finish him</em>, said my parts.
<em>He&rsquo;s sneaky.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Lola, come
here.&rdquo; I held out my arm to Lola, the one that didn&rsquo;t
carry ammunition. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s
not dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is.&rdquo;
My legs hopped forward, and it took an act of will to reign them in.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been running around trying to kill me. He blew up
Better Future. And he kidnapped you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola shook her
head. I was very happy to see Lola alive, but this was rapidly
dampening the longer she took to run into my arms. I wasn&rsquo;t
sure what Lola thought was happening here. I wasn&rsquo;t sure she
realized what I had gone through. &ldquo;Carl didn&rsquo;t kidnap me.
He rescued me.&rdquo;</p>
