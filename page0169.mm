<h5>CHAPTER 
THIRTY-FIVE</h5>
<p>&ldquo;Lola! Oh
Lola, Lola, I thought you were move out of the way.&rdquo; The end of
this sentence surprised me. That wasn&rsquo;t what I meant to say. &ldquo;I
thought you were dead. I thought Carl killed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shot
him,&rdquo; Lola said. It was true. I could see Carl a little better
now. He must have used those metal arms to try to defend himself,
because they were battered and torn, but not effectively enough,
because so was much of his upper torso. His eyes glittered in the
darkness. <em>Finish him</em>, said
my parts. <em>He&rsquo;s
sneaky.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here.&rdquo;
I held out my arm to Lola, the one that didn&rsquo;t carry
ammunition. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s
not dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lola. He
is.&rdquo; My legs hopped forward, and it took an act of will to
reign them in. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been running around trying to kill
me. He blew up Better Future. And he kidnapped you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
She shook her head violently. I was very happy to see Lola alive, but
this was rapidly dampening the longer she took to run into my arms. I
wasn&rsquo;t sure Lola realized what I had gone through for her. I
wasn&rsquo;t sure what she thought was happening here. &ldquo;Carl
rescued me.&rdquo;</p>
