<p>Lola gave a little
shriek. The Better Future van&rsquo;s rear doors banged open. It had
stopped diagonally across the driveway. But we could get around it, I
thought, if we went through the garden bed. &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you
sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
I said, as guards began to spill out of the van. I hadn&rsquo;t seen
Carl yet. But he was be there. I knew it. I had a sudden vision of us
steering past the van, and Carl&rsquo;s metal arm shooting out and
grabbing the bumper. The car&rsquo;s wheels smoking, its engine
screaming, going nowhere. I would turn and look out the rear window
and he would be looking at me with those eyes. <em>Hello again, Dr.
Neumann</em>. &ldquo;Yes, please, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola closed her
eyes. She placed her palms on her lap and blew air through pursed
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you
doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think you should excite me right now, Charlie.&rdquo; Inhale, exhale.
&ldquo;I think I should just keep my eyes closed for a second.&rdquo;
As each guard popped out of the van, he drew a gun. Three, four now.
Fanning out. &ldquo;Because the car won&rsquo;t go without
electronics. That&rsquo;s right, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;
Five guards. &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll
just take a moment...&rdquo; Exhale. &ldquo;And then we&rsquo;ll
drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I decided I didn&rsquo;t
want Lola seeing five guards pointing guns at her. &ldquo;You know
what? Just keep them closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep them
closed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;
I groped for a pole leg. &ldquo;And steer when I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She frowned. &ldquo;Steer
when... what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guards began to
close in. I angled the pole through Lola&rsquo;s legs until it
touched the accelerator. Then I pushed it down, hard. The car leaped
forward. &ldquo;<em>Left!</em>&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;<em>Steer left!</em>&rdquo;</p>
