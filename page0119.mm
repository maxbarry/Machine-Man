<h5>CHAPTER 
TWENTY-FIVE</h5>
<p>There are five
stages of grief. The first is Denial. For example: <em>My legs can&rsquo;t
be dead. They can&rsquo;t be</em>. Next is Anger: <em>You killed my
legs, get out, get your hands off me,</em> etc. There is some
screaming and raging in this stage. Some unfair accusations. Tears
and bruising of feelings. Then comes Bargaining. Much quieter. <em>Just
let the reactor be all right. Please let the reactor be functional.</em>
Fourth is Depression. <em>They&rsquo;re dead. I&rsquo;m dead.</em> And
many not quite precise thoughts. This is a kind of wallowing. A
voluntary shutdown. The final stage is Acceptance. I include no
example here because I was a long, long way from Acceptance.</p>
