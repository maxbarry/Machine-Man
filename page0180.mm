<p>Lola ran after me.
Jason managed to get my Contours to take three more jerky steps, then
Lola caught me and jumped onto my back. &ldquo;I made you a heart,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s at Better Future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
She buried her face in my neck. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really sweet,
Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one you
have now won&rsquo;t last. And I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re
going to give you a new one. But if you shut me down, kill the car,
and paramedics are already on their way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get it.
Stop talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something <em>clang</em>ed
off my chest. I looked around in surprise, and discovered that while
I had been talking with Lola, security guards had begun running at me
with guns. Or, I guess, running at Lola with guns. Cassandra Cautery
was screaming orders, gesturing. Jason pecked frantically at his
device. It was probably only a matter of time before my gun-arm
attempted to kill me, or Lola, or us both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
glad I met you,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo;
she said, and we kissed.</p>
