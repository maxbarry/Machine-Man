<p>Lola ran after me.
My Contours took three more jerky steps, then Lola caught me and
jumped onto my back. I felt her face bury itself in my neck, hot and
wet. &ldquo;I made you a heart,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s at
Better Future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
Her arms squeezed me. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really sweet, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one you
have won&rsquo;t last. And I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going to
give you a new one. But if you take us out, kill the van, and the
cops and paramedics are already on their way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get it.
Stop talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something clanged
off my chest. I looked up to discover that while Lola and I had been
talking, security guards had started running at me with guns. Or,
more likely, running at Lola with guns. Cassandra Cautery screamed
orders, gesturing. Jason bent over his device. It was probably not
long before my gun-arm swept across my shoulders and removed both our
heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
glad I met you,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo;
she said. We kissed.</p>
