<p>Lola and Angelica
took me out of my legs. I became aware of this from a distance, as if
receiving telegrams. I dipped in and out of consciousness like I was
floating down a warm, swift-flowing river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I warned
you,&rdquo; said Angelica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo;
said Lola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is
exactly like that transfibial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it
not exactly like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He loves me.
You don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s done, Angelica. He risked his
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re
the first person to treat him like a human being since he lost a
limb. Of course he loves you. They all love you, at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I opened my eyes,
because there was a strange tugging sensation on my arm. Angelica was
sewing up my skin with a needle and surgical thread. That answered
that question. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
okay, Charlie,&rdquo; said Lola. She stroked my hair. I was lying in
her lap, I think. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s fixing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s
wrong with this guy,&rdquo; Angelica said, &ldquo;I doubt I can fix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only
reason he&rsquo;s not in a psychiatric ward is the company stepped
in. He&rsquo;s a self-injurer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s
chopping parts of himself off. That&rsquo;s a sickness, Lola. That&rsquo;s
self-hate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least
with the transfibial, we could call you a Florence Nightingale. Your
attraction to this man... I don&rsquo;t even know what to call it.
But it&rsquo;s weird, and I&rsquo;m scared it&rsquo;s going to get
you hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo;
said Lola, &ldquo;you like guys with good arms, right? You&rsquo;re
attracted to clumps of muscle fiber. That&rsquo;s weird, to me,
Angelica. Falling for a guy because his eyes are blue, or his face is
symmetrical: these are all weird things. Now I love Charlie. I love
him. And maybe that is weird. Maybe you&rsquo;re right. But it&rsquo;s
all weird. All of this, this whole process of trying to find another
person who fits you, who makes you feel right, is weird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt a sharp pain
penetrate my bubble world. &ldquo;Ungh,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful
with hi,.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
scratch,&rdquo; said Angelica. &ldquo;The bullet barely nicked him.&rdquo;
But her tone sounded mollified. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being gentle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
said Lola.</p>
