<p>I dipped in and out
of consciousness like I was floating down a warm, swift-flowing
river. Lola and Angelica took me out of my legs and I became aware of
this from a distance, as if receiving telegrams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I warned
you,&rdquo; said Angelica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo;
said Lola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is
exactly like that transtibial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He loves me.
You don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s done, Angelica. He risked his
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re
the first person to treat him like a human since he lost a limb. Of
course he loves you. They all love you, at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please.
Let&rsquo;s not get into this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I opened my eyes,
because there was a strange tugging sensation on my arm. Angelica was
sewing up my skin with surgical thread. That answered that question. 
</p>
<p>Lola stroked my
hair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Charlie.&rdquo; I was lying in her lap.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fixing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s
wrong with this guy,&rdquo; Angelica said, &ldquo;I doubt I can fix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only
reason he&rsquo;s not in a psychiatric ward is the company stepped
in. He&rsquo;s a self-injurer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not like that. You don&rsquo;t understand Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you? I
mean it, Lola. These guys, these damaged guys, none of them turn out
like you think. This thing you have, this weird attraction for men
without all their parts, it&rsquo;s not good for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo;
said Lola, &ldquo;like guys with good arms. Right? Well, you&rsquo;re
attracted to clumps of muscle fiber. Isn&rsquo;t that weird? Liking a
guy because of his bone structure, the color of his eyes: aren&rsquo;t
those weird things? I love Charlie. I love him. And maybe that&rsquo;s
weird. But it&rsquo;s <em>all</em> weird. That&rsquo;s what I think,
Angelica. This whole process, trying to find a person who fits you,
who makes you feel right, it&rsquo;s <em>weird</em>. Why does it work
sometimes? Why not other times? What makes a guy want to spend time
with me? Why does how he smells, the sound of his voice, the shape of
his face, make any difference to how I feel about him? I don&rsquo;t
know. I don&rsquo;t know how this works. I just know that sometimes
it does. And when that happens, weird doesn&rsquo;t matter. All that
matters is that it <em>works</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thin pain
penetrated my bubble world. I said: <em>Urk</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
scratch,&rdquo; said Angelica. &ldquo;The bullet barely nicked him.&rdquo;
But she sounded mollified. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being gentle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
said Lola.</p>
