<p>The doctors did not want to let me out of the hospital, which was
funny, because the nurses couldn&rsquo;t be rid of me fast enough.
They argued outside my room in low, strained voices. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
nothing wrong with him,&rdquo; a nurse said. &ldquo;He rolls up and
down the halls in that wheelchair all day long. We need that bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still need a psych evaluation,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t I have that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The company won&rsquo;t allow it. They&rsquo;ll only consent
to interviews conducted with their lawyer present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor sighed, like she spent all day being thwarted by idiots in
suits, and here it was again. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s clearly unstable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could hear the nurse&rsquo;s shrug. &ldquo;They want him released.
What do I tell them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor sighed again. She was going to go home after this and sip
red wine and stare at the wall, I could tell. She would wonder why
she was doing this, struggling against corporate interests when all
she wanted to do was help people, and in the morning, when she walked
out of her beautiful home and unlocked her sports car, she would
remember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I strongly advise he be
kept away from industrial-grade cutting or stamping equipment.&rdquo;</p>
