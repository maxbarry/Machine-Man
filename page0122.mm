<p>It was useful to
talk to my parts as I worked on them. For example, I would pick up a
mirror plate and say, &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s your problem?&rdquo; Or
when contemplating the reactor sheild: &ldquo;You need an arc welder.
That&rsquo;s what you need.&rdquo; They didn&rsquo;t answer back. I
wasn&rsquo;t crazy. It was just a way to focus. But sometimes I heard
footsteps outside the door, and this probably wasn&rsquo;t obvious to
anyone else.</p>
<p>I regretted what I
had said to Lola. How I was shutting myself away. But I couldn&rsquo;t
bring myself to confront her. Surrounded by the Contours&rsquo;
dismembered corpse, I couldn&rsquo;t bear to look at the person who
had killed them. It wasn&rsquo;t Lola&rsquo;s fault. I told the
Contours that. &ldquo;She tried to calm down,&rdquo; I said. This was
late one night, after a particularly frustrating day prying apart
transistors. &ldquo;She did everything she could. She didn&rsquo;t
want you to die.&rdquo; Then I wrapped my arms around myself and
cried a little, because I was really tired.</p>
<p>In the morning, I
decided I would say sorry. I would stop wallowing. I would just fix
one thing first. Because if I could do that, take one step toward
restoring the Contours to function, that would mean they weren&rsquo;t
dead. They were just temporarily knocked out. This idea filled me
with joy. I didn&rsquo;t want to be here, filthy, stinking, grieving,
dragging myself around like some deformed animal. I didn&rsquo;t want
to be alone. I wanted to get past this. So I just had to find one
thing that was fixable.</p>
<p>But that day never
came.</p>
