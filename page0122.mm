<p>I found it useful
to talk to my parts as I worked on them. For example, I would pick up
a mirror plate and say, &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s your problem?&rdquo;
Or, when contemplating the reactor shield: &ldquo;You need an arc
welder. That&rsquo;s what you need.&rdquo; They didn&rsquo;t answer
me. I wasn&rsquo;t crazy. It was just a way to focus. But sometimes I
heard footsteps outside the door, and I realized this probably wasn&rsquo;t
obvious to anyone else.</p>
<p>I regretted what I
had said to Lola. I regretted it a lot. It wasn&rsquo;t Lola&rsquo;s
fault. I told the Contours that. &ldquo;She tried to calm down,&rdquo;
I said. This was very late one night, after a particularly
frustrating few hours prying apart transistors. &ldquo;She did
everything she could. She didn&rsquo;t want you to die.&rdquo; Then I
wrapped my arms around myself and cried a little, because I was
really tired.</p>
<p>When I woke
sometime the next day, as soon as my eyes opened I decided to
apologize to Lola. I would make things right. The idea filled me with
joy. I didn&rsquo;t want to wallow here any more, this filthy,
stinking, grieving thing, dragging itself around. I didn&rsquo;t want
to be angry at Lola, or have her angry at me. But then I sat up and
parts of the Contours fell everywhere. I was sleeping with them to
stave off the phantom pain. Don&rsquo;t ask me why that worked. It
just did. And as parts tumbled to the carpet, I thought: <em>I&rsquo;ll
just fix one thing</em>. Because if I could do that, take a first step
toward restoring functionality, the Contours wouldn&rsquo;t be dead.
They would only be temporarily disabled, like me. And I wouldn&rsquo;t
need to grieve for them.</p>
<p>So I crawled off
the bed and began hunting for one fixable thing. But I never found
it.</p>
