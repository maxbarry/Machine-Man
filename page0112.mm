<p>&ldquo;You should
have been tapering the drugs,&rdquo; said Angelica, preparing the
syringe. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason for you to still be on such a
high level. Who&rsquo;s your doctor at the company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
I grinned. I felt terrific. Angelica hadn&rsquo;t injected me yet,
but I knew what was coming. My body and I were riding up the
rollercoaster, ready for the thrill ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
not right. These are addictive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addiction,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s, what, low levels of dopamine? I can fix
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelica paused.
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fix it. Fix
my brain. This isn&rsquo;t just about legs and a few fingers. This is
a whole-body transformation project. What I&rsquo;ve got planned...&rdquo;
I stopped, because Angelica was no longer looking like she was about
to inject me. &ldquo;Are you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You plan
further amputations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I
do.&rdquo; I was beginning to sweat. &ldquo;Can you please&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelica walked
over and closed the bathroom door. Then she just stood there. I began
to plot ways of getting that syringe out of her hand without breaking
it. &ldquo;To improve yourself. Replace your biological organs with
superior alternatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I licked my lips.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at
yourself. This is self-improvement? You&rsquo;re addicted to
narcotics. Last night you woke screaming because you couldn&rsquo;t
sleep without your prosthetics. You&rsquo;re not making yourself
better. You&rsquo;re getting worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My legs stepped
toward her. Angelica&rsquo;s eyes widened. So did mine, because I
hadn&rsquo;t quite intended that. My brain was dominated by thoughts
of getting that syringe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re
self-destructing,&rdquo; said Angelica. &ldquo;Literally.&rdquo; She
raised her arm, as if to throw the syringe to the tiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! Wait.
I appreciate your concern, Angelica. I do. But this has nothing to do
with you. It&rsquo;s my body. These are my decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I
care about you? I don&rsquo;t. I care about Lola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Lola&rsquo;s
fine. I can look after her. I already have; I rescued her from&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Angelica was
already shaking her head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I want to
hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you
want to hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo;
Angelica said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s perfect just the way she is.&rdquo;</p>
