<p>&ldquo;You should
have been tapering the drugs,&rdquo; said Angelica, drawing clear
liquid into the syringe. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason to still be
on such a high level. Who&rsquo;s your doctor at the company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
I smiled at my reflection in the bathroom mirror. I felt terrific.
Angelica hadn&rsquo;t injected me yet, but I was high on
anticipation. My body and I were in the roller coaster car,
ratcheting up the slope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
not right. These are addictive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addiction,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s, what, low levels of dopamine in the
brain? I can fix that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fix my
brain. This isn&rsquo;t just about legs and a few fingers. This is a
whole-body transformation project. What I&rsquo;ve got planned...&rdquo;
I trailed off, because Angelica was no longer looking like she was
about to inject me. &ldquo;Are you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You plan
further amputations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I
do.&rdquo; I was beginning to sweat. &ldquo;Can you please&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelica walked
over and closed the bathroom door. Then she just stood there. My
brain began to suggest ways of getting that syringe out of her hand
without breaking it. &ldquo;To improve yourself, is that it? Replace
your biological organs with superior alternatives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I licked my lips.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a look
at yourself. You&rsquo;re addicted to narcotics. Last night you woke
screaming because you couldn&rsquo;t sleep without your prosthetics.
This is self-improvement? No. You&rsquo;re not making yourself
better. You&rsquo;re getting worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My legs stepped
toward her. Angelica&rsquo;s eyes widened. So did mine, because I
hadn&rsquo;t quite intended that. All I could think about was getting
that syringe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re
self-destructing,&rdquo; said Angelica. &ldquo;Literally.&rdquo; She
lowered her arm, as if to let the syringe fall to the tiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! Wait!
I appreciate your concern, Angelica. But this has nothing to do with
you. It&rsquo;s my body. These are my decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t
care about you. You can dice yourself into bite-sized pieces, for all
I care. My concern is Lola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Lola&rsquo;s
fine. I can look after her. I already rescued her from&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Angelica was
already shaking her head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I want to
hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo;
I was beginning to panic. &ldquo;What do you want to hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to
hear,&rdquo; said Angelica, &ldquo;that you think she&rsquo;s perfect
just the way she is.&rdquo;</p>
