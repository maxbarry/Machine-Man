<p>&ldquo;You should
have been tapering the drugs,&rdquo; said Angelica, unwrapping the
bandage on my arm. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason for you to still be
on such a high level. Who&rsquo;s your doctor at the company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
I felt terrific. Angelica hadn&rsquo;t even injected me yet. But I
knew what was coming. I was at the top of a super slippery dip, ready
for the ride.</p>
<p>She frowned.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not right. These are addictive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addiction,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s, what, low levels of dopamine? I can fix
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fix it. Fix
my brain. This isn&rsquo;t just about legs and a few fingers. This is
a whole-body transformation project. What I&rsquo;ve got planned...&rdquo;
I stopped, because Angelica was no longer making any move to inject
me. &ldquo;Are you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You plan
further amputations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I
do.&rdquo; I was beginning to sweat. &ldquo;Can you please&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelica walked
over and closed the bathroom door. Then she just stood there, the
needle in her hand. I began to plot ways of getting that needle out
of her hand without breaking it. It was not conscious. I couldn&rsquo;t
help it. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t understand you. I do.
You have this whole pro-technology thing going. You&rsquo;re not
destroying yourself, you&rsquo;re improving. You&rsquo;re on the
vanguard of a range of transformational medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I licked my lips.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except
you&rsquo;re not. Because nobody does this without some form of
hostility toward their own body. I&rsquo;ve heard you couch it in
scientific terms. I&rsquo;ve heard you describe yourself as
objective. I just don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took a step
toward her. Again, I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself. Angelica&rsquo;s
eyes widened and she raised the needle, as if prepared to dash it on
the tiles. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at
yourself,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is self-improvement? You&rsquo;re
addicted to narcotics. Last night you woke up screaming because you
couldn&rsquo;t sleep without your prosthetics. You&rsquo;re not
getting better. You&rsquo;re getting worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to speak
calmly. &ldquo;Well, Angelica, I don&rsquo;t think your opinion
matters very much. Because it&rsquo;s my body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t
about you. You think I care about you? I care about Lola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This softened me.
&ldquo;Lola&rsquo;s safe. I promise. I&rsquo;m not crazy, Angelica. I
can look after her. I swear. What do you want me to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelica said,
&ldquo;Tell me she&rsquo;s perfect just the way she is.&rdquo;</p>
