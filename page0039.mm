<h5>CHAPTER 
NINE</h5>
<p>The place Lola Banks had arranged to meet turned out to be an
upmarket cafe. It had smoked glass and a deep green awning and
wrought iron furniture out on the sidewalk. I felt a twinge of doubt
about my ability to navigate this place without creating a scene.
Then I saw Lola through the glass, sitting at a table with her hair
in a pony-tail, and my heart jumped, and so did my legs. They jogged
up the step and inside and it was all I could do to duck before the
doorway took off my head. Customers turned toward me, pasta dangling
from their forks. I looked like a vagrant, you may recall. A six-foot
six, dust-covered vagrant with titanium hooves. But Lola turned
toward me and I stopped caring what other people thought, because
there was nothing on her face but radiant joy.</p>
