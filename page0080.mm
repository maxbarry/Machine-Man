<p>&ldquo;Clavicle,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Well,
let&rsquo;s talk bones. They&rsquo;re only strong and lightweight by
biological standards. I can think of six carbon polymers that are
lighter and stronger off the top of my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t want to
break.&rdquo; Lola probed her clavicle with her fingers. Her skin
glowed almost red in the light of the setting sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. You don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It feels vulnerable.&rdquo; She
took my hand and pressed my fingers to her clavicle. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I swallowed. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my ribs?&rdquo; She guided
my hand lower, over her sweater, until my fingers rested on the
Better Future logo. An inch lower, the word DARING rose and fell
across her right breast. &ldquo;Should they be carbon polymer, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I got shot. My ribs were
not bulletproof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. If they... if we had...
done something about that...&rdquo; The air was thickening. I could
barely suck it in. &ldquo;Carbon polymer is... just... an example.
There are several... lightweight...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They put pins in my ribs. Can
you feel them?&rdquo; She moved my hand lower. I touched DARING.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I... like...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her fingers closed over my other hand.
I was wearing a glove, because earlier I had attached some
remote-sensing digits for electronic work, and I didn&rsquo;t want to
knock them on things. &ldquo;Can you feel... with this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m... not sure. They
mainly convert electromagnetic signals into language my nerves can
understand. For example, the radio spectrum around three gigahertz
feels like candy floss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I feel like?&rdquo; She
moved my hand up, toward the side of the sweater that said VISION.
Her eyes locked onto mine. It was a highly charged moment. Then my
hand twitched and I jabbed my fingers into her sternum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; I pulled
back my hand. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; She
pressed closer. &ldquo;Try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; I said, distracted.
Because pulling my hand away from Lola&rsquo;s chest, that had been
harder than it should have.</p>
