<p>&ldquo;Clavicle,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Well,
let&rsquo;s talk bones. They&rsquo;re only strong and lightweight by
biological standards. I can think of six carbon polymers that are
lighter and stronger off the top of my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t want to
break.&rdquo; Lola probed her clavicle with her fingers. Her skin
glowed almost red in the light of the setting sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. You don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It feels vulnerable.&rdquo; She
took my hand and pressed my fingers to her clavicle. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I swallowed. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my ribs?&rdquo; She guided
my hand lower, over her sweater, until my fingers rested on the
Better Future logo. An inch lower, the word DARING rose and fell
across her right breast. &ldquo;Should they be carbon polymer, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I got shot. My ribs were
not bulletproof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. If they... if we had...
done something about that...&rdquo; The air was thickening. I could
barely suck it in. &ldquo;Carbon polymer is... just... an example.
There are several... lightweight...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They put pins in my ribs. Can
you feel them?&rdquo; She moved my hand lower. I touched DARING.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I... like...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her fingers closed over my other hand.
I was wearing a glove, because earlier I had attached some
remote-sensing digits for electronic work, and I didn&rsquo;t want to
knock them on things. &ldquo;Can you feel... with this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m... not sure,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;They mainly convert electromagnetic signals into
language my nerves can understand. For example, the radio spectrum
around three gigahertz feels like candy floss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I feel like?&rdquo; She
moved my hand up, toward the side of the sweater that said VISION.
Her eyes locked onto mine. It was a highly charged moment. Then my
hand twitched and I accidentally jabbed my fingers into her sternum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; I pulled
back my hand. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; She
pressed herself against me. &ldquo;Try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; I said, distracted.
Because pulling my hand away from Lola&rsquo;s chest, that had been
harder than it should have.</p>

WEDNESDAY</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off the glove,&rdquo; Lola
said. &ldquo;Come on. Let me see your fingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pulled my hand out of her reach.
&ldquo;Wait. My fingers are attracted to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mutal.&rdquo; She
reached for them again. &ldquo;Stop teasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand. Not
romantically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me, confused. Then she
realized what I meant, and she stepped back. As she did, I rocked
backward a little, as if I had been bracing myself against a force
too subtle to notice until it was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you feel that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I... don&rsquo;t know. What is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie. I&rsquo;m scared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; I said,
although I didn&rsquo;t know if that was true. &ldquo;Wait here. I&rsquo;ll
get a scanner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me.&rdquo; She
clasped her hands. &ldquo;What did they put in me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes filled with tears. She was
about to break down. And then we would have a problem, because I
wasn&rsquo;t sure I could move within two feet of her without
damaging one of us. But she sucked in a quavering breath and nodded.
&ldquo;Hurry.&rdquo;</p>

THURSDAY</p>
<p>I hit the button for the elevator and
bounced up and down in the Contours while I waited. I was tempted to
take an express route, like leaping out a window and walking back in
through the lobby. Because I could do that. But that would be a bad
idea for the same reason I wasn&rsquo;t walking Lola Banks to the
labs: it would let everyone around me know that something was up.</p>
<p>Of course, I was being stupid again. I
was assuming that Lola&rsquo;s suite was private. And this was
clearly not the case, because when the elevator finally arrived, it
had Cassandra Cautery in it. &ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Can
we chat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Page 83.
FRIDAY</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing I&rsquo;d like
to lay on the table,&rdquo; Cassandra Cautery said when the elevator
doors had closed, &ldquo;just so it&rsquo;s out there, is that we&rsquo;ve
made a fairly significant investment in Lola Banks. That life-saving
operation did not come cheap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The life-saving operation she
needed after Carl shot her,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
one you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes remained fixed on the floor
numbers ticking over on the elevator panel screen. &ldquo;The second
thing is we&rsquo;ve made a significant investment in <em>you</em>. In
providing the resources you need, to do what you want to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in
Lola&rsquo;s chest. Something that&rsquo;s not a heart. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie, Charlie,&rdquo; she
said, and there was something odd about her tone: a tightness I had
not heard before. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to do the right thing by
you. I really have. When you asked me to dispose of Carl, did I
quibble? Did I say, <em>Gee, that&rsquo;s a little </em><em>heartless,
he&rsquo;s a ten-year employee with no arms?</em>
No. I did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>She glanced at me.
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire
Carl. I asked you to <em>fire</em>
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually,
your exact words were <em>get rid of</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated. &ldquo;Of
course it is. But the point is, I&rsquo;ve tried my hardest to make
this a warm, supportive environment for you. I have sheltered you
from the many painful decisions that had to be made to provide this
environment. And there have been many, Charlie. There have been
many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevator doors
opened. We were not on the labs sublevel. We were somewhere I had
never been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now I
can&rsquo;t shelter you.&rdquo; I finally realized what that
tightness was in Cassandra Cautery&rsquo;s voice. It was nerves. &ldquo;Now
we&rsquo;re all going to have a little reality check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stared at the
wall opposite. On it hung a huge, ornately-framed mirror; to one side
was a little table bearing a lamp and a vase of white flowers, and to
the other was a life-sized statue that may have been some Roman god.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to meet
the boss,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. She gestured. &ldquo;After
you.&rdquo;</p>
