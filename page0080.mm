<p>&ldquo;Clavicle,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Well,
let&rsquo;s talk bones. They&rsquo;re only strong and lightweight by
biological standards. I can think of six carbon polymers that are
lighter and stronger off the top of my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t want to
break.&rdquo; Lola probed her clavicle with her fingers. Her skin
glowed almost red in the light of the setting sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. You don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It feels vulnerable.&rdquo; She
took my hand and pressed my fingers to her clavicle. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I swallowed. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my ribs?&rdquo; She guided
my hand lower, over her sweater, until my fingers rested on the
Better Future logo. An inch lower, the word DARING rose and fell
across her right breast. &ldquo;Should they be carbon polymer, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I got shot. My ribs were
not bulletproof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. If they... if we had...
done something about that...&rdquo; The air was thickening. I could
barely suck it in. &ldquo;Carbon polymer is... just... an example.
There are several... lightweight...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They put pins in my ribs. Can
you feel them?&rdquo; She moved my hand lower. I touched DARING.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I... like...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her fingers closed over my other hand.
I was wearing a glove, because earlier I had attached some
remote-sensing digits for electronic work, and I didn&rsquo;t want to
knock them on things. &ldquo;Can you feel... with this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m... not sure,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;They mainly convert electromagnetic signals into
language my nerves can understand. For example, the radio spectrum
around three gigahertz feels like candy floss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I feel like?&rdquo; She
moved my hand up, toward the side of the sweater that said VISION.
Her eyes locked onto mine. It was a highly charged moment. Then my
hand twitched and I accidentally jabbed my fingers into her sternum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; I pulled
back my hand. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; She
pressed herself against me. &ldquo;Try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; I said, distracted.
Because pulling my hand away from Lola&rsquo;s chest, that had been
harder than it should have.</p>

WEDNESDAY</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off the glove,&rdquo; Lola
said. &ldquo;Come on. Let me see your fingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pulled my hand out of her reach.
&ldquo;Wait. My fingers are attracted to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mutal.&rdquo; She
reached for them again. &ldquo;Stop teasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t understand.
Not romantically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me, confused. Then she
realized what I meant, and stepped back. As she did, I rocked
backward a little, as if I had been braced against an invisible force
I hadn&rsquo;t even noticed until it was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you feel that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I... I don&rsquo;t know. What is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo; I
backed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie. I&rsquo;m scared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; I said,
although I didn&rsquo;t know if that was true. &ldquo;Wait here. I&rsquo;ll
be right back. With a scanner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me.&rdquo; She
clasped her hands, her eyes filling with tears. &ldquo;What did they
put in me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought she might break down. And
then we would have a problem, because I wasn&rsquo;t sure I could
move within two feet of her without doing damage to one of us.</p>
<p>Lola sucked in a breath and nodded.
&ldquo;Hurry.&rdquo;</p>

THURSDAY</p>
<p>I hit the button for the elevator and
waited. It took so long I was tempted to take a more express route,
like leaping out a window and walking back in through the lobby.
Because I could do that. But that would be a bad idea for the same
reason I wasn&rsquo;t walking Lola Banks to the labs: it would give
away that something was up.</p>
<p>Of course, I was being stupid again. I
was assuming that Lola&rsquo;s suite was private. And this was
clearly not the case, because when the elevator finally arrived, it
had Cassandra Cautery in it. &ldquo;Hello, Charlie,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Can I give you some advice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Page 82.
FRIDAY</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Some time later, when I finally dragged
myself out of Lola&rsquo;s suite, I came around a corner to find
Cassandra Cautery standing outside the Glass Room, her arms folded.
This gave me a nasty shock, because I had been thinking very
pleasant, Lola-related thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look who&rsquo;s finally showing
up for work,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost
noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stopped. I never knew whether I
should lower the Contours when in conversation with Cassandra
Cautery. It felt wrong to tower over her, but I didn&rsquo;t want to,
well, condescend. &ldquo;Does that matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Charlie.&rdquo;
She put her hands on her hips. &ldquo;Does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you were just. And I
have to tell you, Charlie, I did not authorize a six hundred thousand
dollar operation so that woman could steal you away from your work. I
did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was too confused to speak. If I had
to characterize Cassandra Cautery&rsquo;s behavior, I would have said
<em>jealous</em>. But that made no
sense. She had no romantic feelings for me. I would bet my life on
that. But I didn&rsquo;t know what else this could be.</p>
<p>She walked toward me. She did this very
deliberately, as if we were surrounded by explosives, and a false
move could set them off. &ldquo;This relationship only works if we
trust each other, Charlie. Do you understand that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What
relationship?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Then she walked away.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

FRIDAY</p>
<p>At first I put the conversation with
Cassandra Cautery out of my mind for the rest of the day, because it
was too bizarre to process. But as I worked, unease stole into my
body. Eventually I pushed myself away from my computer and its
virtual models and stared at the ceiling tiles. After a while, I
figured it out. Cassandra Cautery was mad at Lola. I didn&rsquo;t
know why. But that was not a good situation. And the more I thought
about it, the more I thought it was not a safe one.</p>
