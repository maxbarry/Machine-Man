<p>Cass Caut. Finds them, a little
disturbed by the romance maybe, hints that Carl is dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you go,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Your arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I touched them, etc. &ldquo;What about
Carl? What arms did you give him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assume you didn&rsquo;t push
him out the door with no arms,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Did you take him
to a clinic or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery was silent a moment.
&ldquo;You remember, Charlie, we had a discussion about what to do
with Carl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. And I asked you to
fire him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t say <em>fire</em>.
You said <em>get rid of</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo;
said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;Yeah. I know. Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;So where&rsquo;s Carl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taken care of,&rdquo; said
Cassandra Cautery.</p>
