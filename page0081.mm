<p>&ldquo;Take off the glove,&rdquo; Lola
said. &ldquo;Come on. Let me see your fingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pulled my hand out of her reach.
&ldquo;Wait. My fingers are attracted to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mutal.&rdquo; She
reached for them again. &ldquo;Stop teasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand. Not
romantically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me, confused. Then she
realized what I meant, and she stepped back. As she did, I rocked
backward a little, as if I had been bracing myself against a force
too subtle to notice until it was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you feel that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I... don&rsquo;t know. What is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie. I&rsquo;m scared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; I said,
although I didn&rsquo;t know if that was true. &ldquo;Wait here. I&rsquo;ll
get a scanner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me.&rdquo; She
clasped her hands. &ldquo;What did they put in me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes filled with tears. She was
about to break down. And then we would have a problem, because I
wasn&rsquo;t sure I could move within two feet of her without
damaging one of us. But she sucked in a quavering breath and nodded.
&ldquo;Hurry.&rdquo;</p>
