<p>&ldquo;How about
that EMP weapon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carl&rsquo;s
shielded.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt; CC wants to
build Bioreplacements, just clean up Carl first. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;For reasons
we haven&rsquo;t adequately explored, not everyone adjusted to their
Bioreplacement as effortlessly as you did.&rdquo;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Lola was looking at
me. &ldquo;Do you miss your legs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure
how to answer this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel
like you want them back?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; soft
sciences: Charlie asks Lola about id. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Id comprises the unorganised
part of the personality structure that contains the basic drives. It
acts according to the pleasure principle, seeking to avoid pain or
unpleasure. </em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A low, keening
noise came out of Lola. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Company
always has to make the most of opportunity. It&rsquo;s emotionless.
Purely logical. Like a machine. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me
explain something about our company to you, Charlie. It has no
emotion. It can seem like it does, because it acts through its
employees, and those of course are people. But behind them is a legal
entity that has no regard for feelings. You can insult our company.
You can poke it in the eye. And it won&rsquo;t poke you back. Not
unless it&rsquo;s beneficial to do so.&rdquo;  She eyed me. &ldquo;Like
a machine, you know? Think of Better Future as a machine with eight
thousand employees. An artificial intelligence programmed to shift
resources around to generate wealth and power.&rdquo;</p>
