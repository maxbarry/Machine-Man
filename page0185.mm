<p>&ldquo;Charlie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I opened my eyes.
No, I didn&rsquo;t. I had no eyes. I was simply, abruptly aware. And
I saw Lola. She was watching me, her chin resting on the heel of one
hand, her elbow on the bench top. Her hair looked as if she had
pulled it into a neat pony-tail, then walked through a blizzard. She
wore a white shirt with a grease stain on the collar. She was here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you.&rdquo;
She reached out and rested a hand on what felt like my head, but
wasn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;There you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Lola</em>,
I said. <em>Oh Lola, it&rsquo;s so good to see you. I don&rsquo;t
know what&rsquo;s happened, and can you hear me? I can&rsquo;t talk.
Lola, I can see you but I can&rsquo;t talk.</em></p>
<p>Her eyes shone. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
talking, Charlie. Here. Let me...&rdquo; She swiveled my camera until
I could see the monitor: <span class="charlietext">I
CANNOT TALK LOLA I CAN SEE YOU BUT I CANNOT TALK</span><em>.</em>
&ldquo;See? You&rsquo;re talking. We&rsquo;re talking, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">AM
I IN THERE IS MY BRAIN IN THERE</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Well...
yes. But not your <em>brain</em> brain. You&rsquo;re pretty much solid
state now.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">HOW
AM I SOLID STATE</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Charlie,
I&rsquo;ve been dying to tell you about it. It&rsquo;s amazing. I
mean, I <em>have</em> told you about it, a thousand times. But until
now you couldn&rsquo;t hear me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">I
AM A ROBOT</span>, wrote
the screen. <span class="charlietext">I
AM A BOX DEAD MACHINE BOX</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Charlie.
You&rsquo;re not a box. The box is your body, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">DO
NOT WANT TO BE A BOX LOLA</span></p>
<p>She stroked my
camera. I couldn&rsquo;t feel it. But it was comforting anyway. &ldquo;They
took you away from me, Charlie. After we kissed, and my heart fried
everything, the Better Future people tried to drag you away. They got
you about ten feet, then they dropped you and tried to run away
because the police were coming. I could see you, Charlie, but I
couldn&rsquo;t reach you. The paramedics put me in an ambulance and I
didn&rsquo;t see you for ten days.&rdquo; She straightened and
unbuttoned her shirt. There was a white scar across her chest: thick,
not new. &ldquo;I made them give me the heart you made for me. I had
to yell at some people. But I got it. I&rsquo;ve had to yell at a lot
of people over the last three years, Charlie, because they kept
wanting to give up on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">THREE
YEARS HOW IS IT THREE YEARS</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It feels
like three days, all of a sudden.&rdquo; She leaned close, her face
aglow with excitement. &ldquo;So let me tell you about the box.
Because I know this is a lot to take in, but seriously, you are going
to love it. The box has ports.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">PORTS</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You can
plug things into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">THINGS
WHAT THINGS</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s
an interesting question, Charlie. It&rsquo;s a question you probably
want to put some serious thought into yourself. But, well, while I&rsquo;ve
been waiting, I kind of went ahead and... oh, Charlie, I was going to
surprise you, but I can&rsquo;t wait! I&rsquo;m just going to say it.
I made you an arm. You can probably do better. Much better. But I
wanted to give you something. Something in return. Something I made
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">YOU
MADE ME AN ARM LOLA</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
kind of stupidly proud about it, Charlie. I mean, it can&rsquo;t lift
cars or anything. It&rsquo;s just a prosthetic. But it&rsquo;s a
start.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">A
START</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;
She lay her head on her arm, her free hand continuing to stroke my
camera. It seemed a familiar position for her, as if she had done
this many times before. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was odd, knowing
I was seeing her through a camera lens. But not as odd as I would
have thought. I wondered if perhaps people could adapt to anything.
Now I thought about it, it was pretty strange that human beings felt
comfortable walking around in bodies that were mostly made of juice.
That was actually bizarre.</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">CAN
YOU SHOW ME THE ARM</span>, I said.</p>
<p></p>
