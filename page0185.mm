<p>&ldquo;Charlie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I opened my eyes.
No, I didn&rsquo;t. I had no eyes. I was simply, abruptly aware. And
I saw her: Lola. She had one hand supporting her chin, her elbow on
the benchtop. Her hair looked as if she had pulled it into a neat
pony-tail, then walked through a blizzard. She wore a white collared
shirt with what was possibly a grease stain on the cuff. She was
here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you.&rdquo;
Her free hand reached out and rested on what felt like my head, but
wasn&rsquo;t. It was my camera. &ldquo;There you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Lola</em>,
I said. <em>Oh Lola, it&rsquo;s so good to see you and I don&rsquo;t
know what&rsquo;s happened and can you hear me, Lola? I can&rsquo;t
talk, I can see you but I can&rsquo;t talk.</em></p>
<p>Her eyes shone. &ldquo;You are talking.
Here. Let me...&rdquo; She swiveled me around so that I could see the
gray box with its attached monitor. It said: <span class="charlietext">I
CANNOT TALK I CAN SEE YOU BUT I CANNOT TALK</span><em>.</em>
&ldquo;See?&rdquo; She moved closer, staying within camera range.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking. We&rsquo;re talking, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">AM
I IN THERE IS MY BRAIN IN THERE</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Well,
yes. But not your <em>brain</em> brain. You&rsquo;re solid state.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">HOW
AM I SOLID STATE</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been dying to tell you about it, Charlie. It&rsquo;s amazing. Well. I
<em>have</em> told you about it. Like about a thousand times. But you
couldn&rsquo;t hear me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">I
AM A ROBOT</span>, wrote
the screen. <span class="charlietext">I
AM A BOX DEAD MACHINE BOX</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Charlie.
You&rsquo;re not a box. The box is your body, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">DO
NOT WANT TO BE A BOX LOLA</span></p>
<p>She stroked my
camera a while. I couldn&rsquo;t feel it. But it was comforting
anyway. &ldquo;They took you away from me, Charlie. After we kissed,
and my heart fried everything, the Better Future people tried to drag
you to their truck. They shifted you about ten feet, then they
dropped you and tried to run away because the police were coming. I
could see you, Charlie, but I couldn&rsquo;t reach you. The
paramedics put me in an ambulance and then I didn&rsquo;t see you for
four days.&rdquo; She straightened and unbuttoned her shirt. There
was a white scar across her chest: thick, not new. &ldquo;I made them
give me the heart you made for me. I had to yell at some people. But
I got it. I&rsquo;ve had to yell at a lot of people over the last
three years, Charlie, because they keep wanting to give up on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">THREE
YEARS HOW IS IT THREE YEARS</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It feels
like three days, all of a sudden.&rdquo; She smiled, and leaned close
again. &ldquo;So let me tell you about the box. Because I know this
is a lot to take in, but seriously, you are going to love this. The
box has ports.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">PORTS</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Right.
You can plug things into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">THINGS
WHAT THINGS</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s
an interesting question, Charlie. It&rsquo;s probably a question you
want to put some serious thought into yourself. But, well, while I&rsquo;ve
been waiting, I kind of went ahead and... I was going to surprise
you. But now I can&rsquo;t wait! I&rsquo;m just going to say it. I
made you an arm. You can probably do better. Much better. But I
wanted to give you something. Like you gave me a heart. Something I
made, that could be part of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">YOU
MADE ME AN ARM LOLA</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
kind of stupidly proud about it, Charlie. I mean, it can&rsquo;t lift
cars or anything. It&rsquo;s just a prosthetic. But it&rsquo;s a
start.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">A
START</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;
She smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was odd, knowing
I was seeing her through a camera lens. But not as odd as I would
have thought. I wondered if perhaps people could adapt to anything.
Now I thought about it, it was kind of strange that human beings felt
comfortable walking around in bodies that were mostly made of juice.
That was actually bizarre.</p>
<p><span class="charlietext">CAN
YOU SHOW ME THE ARM</span>, I said.</p>
<p></p>
