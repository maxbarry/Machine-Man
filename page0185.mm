<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;
said Lola. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a prosthetic arm. That&rsquo;s for you. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no.
You&rsquo;re solid state.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>HOW AM I SOLID STATE</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s...&rdquo;
She shuffled closer. Her eyes were filled with excitement. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been dying to talk to you about it, Charlie. It&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>I AM A ROBOT</em>,
wrote the screen. <em>I AM A BOX BOX DEAD MACHINE BOX</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
She put her chin on her hands. &ldquo;No, Charlie. You&rsquo;re not a
box. The box is your new body, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>DO NOT WANT TO BE A BOX LOLA</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Let me tell you about the box. Because the box has
ports. You can plug things into it.&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;I have
this arm I&rsquo;ve been working on, Charlie. I don&rsquo;t want to
spoil the surprise, because I&rsquo;ve been saving it up for three
years, but it is kind of special.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>YOU HAVE YOU HAVE THREE YEARS</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. It&rsquo;s
been a while, Charlie. But we made it.&rdquo; She looked around. &ldquo;My
bed is over in the corner there. I convinced them to let me bunk in
here.&rdquo; She looked back at me. &ldquo;They wanted to give up on
you, Charlie. They said there was nothing left to save. I told them,
there&rsquo;s nothing left of his <em>body</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>LOLA LOLA</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a
peek.&rdquo; She leaned forward and pulled down her top. There was a
white scar across her chest: not a new one. She sat back. &ldquo;I
got your heart. I had to yell at a lot of people. But I got it.
You&rsquo;ve been with me the whole time, Charlie. We haven&rsquo;t
been apart one minute.&rdquo; She looked around. &ldquo;My bed is in
the corner there. That was another thing I had to yell at them
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>THREE YEARS HOW IS IT THREE YEARS</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;It feels
like three days, all of a sudden,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
back and it&rsquo;s like you were never gone. We&rsquo;re talking,
Charlie. We&rsquo;re talking!&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;So let me
tell you about the box,&rdquo; Lola said. Her eyes sparkled. &ldquo;Because
I get that this is a big shock, but seriously, you are going to love
this. The box has ports.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>PORTS</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You can
plug things into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>WHAT THINGS</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s an interesting question, Charlie.
That&rsquo;s a very interesting question. And it&rsquo;s probably the
kind of question you want to put some serious thought into answering.
But, well, while I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you, I kind of went
ahead and got started. I...&rdquo; She bit her lip. &ldquo;I was
going to surprise you. But now I can&rsquo;t wait. I&rsquo;m just
going to tell you. I made you an arm. You can probably do better. But
I wanted you to have something. Something from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>YOU MADE ME AN ARM LOLA</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;
She grinned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty cool, Charlie. I mean, it can&rsquo;t
shoot bullets or anything. It&rsquo;s just a prosthetic. But it&rsquo;s
a start.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>A START</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;
said Lola. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what this is, Charlie. A start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at her. It
was odd, knowing I was seeing her through a camera lens. But not as
odd as I would have thought. Maybe people could get used to anything.
Now I thought about it, it was a little strange people could feel
comfortable in bodies that were almost entirely made of juice. That
was pretty freaky, to be honest.</p>
<p><em>CAN YOU SHOW ME
THE ARM</em>, I said.</p>
