<p>&ldquo;My arm is

because compared to the rest of me, that arm looked very weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His arm is
cold,&rdquo; echoed Jason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could...
um, obviously not a shirt, that wouldn&rsquo;t fit...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could
bandage it,&rdquo; suggested someone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that
restrict movement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some kind of
pancho? A hole for his head...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would
flap around. That doesn&rsquo;t cover his arm at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut the arm
off a jacket, attach a tether... no, wait...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it,&rdquo;
I said, because watching the brightest minds in Better Future stumped
by clothing was a little too much to bear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay.&rdquo;</p>
