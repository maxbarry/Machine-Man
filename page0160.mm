<p>They sent me out
through the underground parking lot, to avoid being seen by the
emergency services people who were apparently crawling around above
us. I didn&rsquo;t understand how the parking lot would make any
difference, since it exited in the same general area, but I was no
longer worrying about details. I was prepared to assume Better Future
would take care of things while I focused on the big-picture goal of
running until I found Carl and then shooting him.</p>
<p>The parking lot was
lit by a portable generator and a series of halogen lights, which
made everything either blindingly bright or lost in impenetrable
shadow. Better Future vans and Hummers idled in the dark, their
chrome reflecting like supernovas, tailpipes belching fumes. &ldquo;Hold
here a second, please,&rdquo; said Jason, and people swarmed me,
performing final checks. Someone wrapped me in a top, a security
guard jacket with one arm cut off.</p>
<p>My legs hiccupped
forward. &ldquo;Only another minute,&rdquo; said Jason. He thought it
was me. It wasn&rsquo;t. I could feel my legs&rsquo; impatience. Soon
they were going to start running whether these people were ready or
not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All clear,&rdquo;
said a lab tech. They began backing away. People climbed into vans;
doors slammed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;
Cassandra Cautery walked up to me. Her head was bandaged. &ldquo;One
thing, before you go.&rdquo; Then she simply stood there. I didn&rsquo;t
want to tell her to hurry up, but unless she moved, I was going to
run through her. She reached for my face. I was not sure about this,
but it was a little late to stop trusting Cassandra Cautery, so I
bent down. She stretched on tip-toes, placed her hands on my cheeks,
and kissed me. &ldquo;Be careful.&rdquo;</p>
