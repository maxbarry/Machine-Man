<p>At that point I
suspect the driver had to make a call between flipping the vehicle
and coming down on four wheels only in time to ram the building, and
he chose to flip. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>and then it went. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>A good driver could
probably have avoided this, I think, but

<p>What was I doing? I
was a thinker, not a soldier. I wasn&rsquo;t maximizing my strengths.
</p>
<p>This assault
business, this was a really stupid idea. 
</p>
<p>I should get out of
here and make some phone calls.</p>

<p>This was easier
said than done. Well, not <em>easier</em>; all I had to do was tell the
Contours to jump up there. Then I&rsquo;d discover if they could. But
that was some leap of faith. It was one thing to know my legs were
programmed to never exceed my physical tolerances; it was another to
believe it.</p>
<p>What if Lola wasn&rsquo;t
there? What if Cassandra Cautery had already moved her? That would
screw me.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The issue with this
is I had to exit the same way. 
</p>
<p>Squeezing through
the gash was a reminder that my bottom half was titanium

<p>I recalled that
expression: <em>When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a
nail</em>. I had two hammers. And I was seeing a lot of nails.</p>
