<p>I rocketed up the
side of the Better Future building. Smoked glass offices flashed past
my face. At the top of my arc through the air, I cleared a railing
with about two inches to spare, and landed on the balcony as gently
as if I was stepping out of my house. This would be by far the
coolest thing I&rsquo;d ever done, if I hadn&rsquo;t just kicked a
Hummer into a building. But I barely even felt surprise. I had
realized something, down there on the lawn: I could trust my legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie!&rdquo;
It was Lola, coming out of the suite. I had picked the right balcony;
of course I had. She threw herself into my arms. &ldquo;Did you feel
that, a second ago? Was that an earthquake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me,
then leaned over the balcony. &ldquo;Did you jump up here? Did you
<em>jump</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some stuff
has happened. We need to get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s
that smoke? Is that a car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lola.&rdquo;
I took hold of her shoulders. Her eyes expanded until they covered
the world. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important we get out of here as fast as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sucked in
breath. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the point
I realized I couldn&rsquo;t jump out of here. Or rather, I couldn&rsquo;t
do it with Lola. The moment my legs touched the ground and began to
decelerate the rest of me, Lola would weigh the equivalent of two
thousand pounds. There was no way I could hold her.</p>
<p>Lola took my hand,
the biological one. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside, I heard
the ding of the elevator. That would be security.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d
come back,&rdquo; she said. She was shining again: looking at me like
I was the greatest thing in the world. &ldquo;I knew it.&rdquo;</p>
