<h5>CHAPTER 
THIRTY-THREE</h5>

<p></p>
<p>But I guess I got
the gist, because when he finished, I had a new thought, and this
was: <em>Carl doesn&rsquo;t sound that crazy.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Charlie
realizes Carl doesn&rsquo;t sound that insane. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; He talks
to his legs &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Charlie
should vomit. Only it&rsquo;s not food. He should still feel weepy
about what he has become. He&rsquo;s separating from his parts. And
BF is trying to bundle him out the door as quickly as possible. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Releasing
a cat to catch a mouse... releasing a dog to catch the cat. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Since then, I have
increasingly believed that human beings are inherently predictable.
Threaten us with harm and we run away. Warm us and we relax. Offer us
six hundred dollars a week if we sit at a desk and answer phone
calls, and we will sit at a desk and answer phone calls. We are more
complex than vending machines, of course. But the distinction is of
degrees, not difference. Give me infinite computing power and perfect
knowledge of environmental variables, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can
model consciousness. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that one day, not too far
from now, we will have definitive proof that we are all vending
machines.</p>

had not been lying about the improved tactile feedback</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; drugs make
him happy&mdash;the <em>make </em>him, appropriate term because he is
now comprised of drugs &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>At first I missed
the last word; I thought he said, These drugs will make you, and was
confused, although then I thought that that was probably accurate. I
was made of drugs.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; you flood
my brain with endorphins and I become a different person &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>And right now, I
didn&rsquo;t have time to waste on emotions. I had things to figure
out.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;
said Jason.</p>
<p>Emotions were
incentives. When you felt tired, it was because your muscles ___. You
felt hungry . You felt horny because your biology wanted to
reproduce. And the thing was, 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>incentives. When we
felt tired, that was because 
</p>
<p>We felt tired to
encourage us to rest muscles that required repair; we felt hungry to
encourage us to refuel. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>there were
particular chemicals interacting in my brain, and 
</p>
<p>Emotions were
motivators. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Bringing
it all online. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Connecting
the hub,&rdquo; said Jason. &ldquo;Dr. Neumann, this might feel
strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the last ten
minutes I had felt tired, euphoric, furious, hungry, afraid, and like
I was drowning. It was hard to tell which of these feelings were
coming from me and not the many chemicals that were being introduced
to my system, although maybe that was a pointless distinction. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>My brain was reacting to chemicals; I
should leave it at that. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Me</em> at this
point was hard to define. But I doubted that whatever Jason was doing
now, it would 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t
seem likely that <em>strange</em> would bother me at this point. Then
something hit the back of my brain and I needed to vomit. I bent over
and opened my mouth and nothing happened. I had no stomach muscles to
contract. My throat clicked open and closed. &ldquo;Gugg. Gagg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn that
down,&rdquo; Jason said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s way too high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nausea faded.
Sweat dripped down my face. I strained, desperate to throw up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry. What
we&rsquo;ve connected you to is the 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>until I realized
that was a distinction I FUCK FUCK FUCK. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t
try. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to
pee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s...
I don&rsquo;t know what that is,&rdquo; said Jason. &ldquo;But you
can&rsquo;t pee, so it should be safe to go ahead and feel like
you&rsquo;re doing that.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;You can
track Carl with this,&rdquo; said Jason. <em>This</em> was 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop
moving,&rdquo; the doctor said. &ldquo;This is a fracture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So fix it.&rdquo;
She gestured. &ldquo;This guy is eighty percent artificial, you think
you can handle a bump on the head?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
feeling a little like the old woman who swallowed a fly,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;She swallowed a spider to catch the fly, she swallowed a
bird to catch the spider...&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the last
twenty minutes I had been talking to my parts. It had begun with me
seeing 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>was an odd
conversation. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; This is
how you talk to us. This is how you track Carl. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Legs
online: he feels them. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It seemed to me
that she had wilfully missed the point. The question wasn&rsquo;t
whether people had free will. I had no idea. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>and she began
explaining various theories of free will. But that was missing the
point. It was like everything they talked about in Humanities:
semantics, games with labels. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I just thought we
had a lot in common with vending machines.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>explain to an
objective, independent observor that I was the independent variable
making choices of my own free will in this situation, 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If an alien visitor
was watching, I decided, it would not be easy to convince</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; But then
&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;As I stared at the dangling Doritos packet, &gt;&gt;
a different way of looking at the situation occurred to me. In this
scenario, the vending machine was intelligent and I was a machine.
The vending machine, for reasons of its own&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think
it&rsquo;s important to know the vending machine&rsquo;s motivation,
but say it was bored&mdash;poked my buttons in order to elicit
particular behaviors. This scenario made sense because if you
replaced me with a different human being they would have acted the
same way. There was nothing unique or unpredictable about me getting
mad; an intelligent vending machine would know that&rsquo;s what
humans do when you dangle snacks in front of them.</p>
<p><A NAME="firstHeading1"></A>I
spent the rest of the day trying to think why an objective observor
should believe I was controlling the vending machine in this
situation and not the other way around. And I couldn&rsquo;t. I had a
brain and the vending machine didn&rsquo;t, but that was classic
anthropocentrism: for all I
knew, the vending machine&rsquo;s consciousness resided in a space I
didn&rsquo;t understand. It might argue I couldn&rsquo;t have
consciousness because I didn&rsquo;t have a coin slot. 
</p>
<p>That was when I
decided there wasn&rsquo;t much difference between humans and
machines. We&rsquo;re more complex, of course, but it&rsquo;s a
distinction of degrees, not difference. We&rsquo;re all vending
machines.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>everyone likes to
believe they are unique, thinking and acting in ways no-one else has
before, 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>back in my room and
hungry, something about that encounter stuck with me. It&rsquo;s
always humiliating to be defeated by an inanimate object, of course,
especially one designed to do what you want, but what bothered me was
my own behavior. The way I had acted was almost stereotypical.</p>
