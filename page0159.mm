<h5>CHAPTER 
THIRTY-THREE</h5>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There were many
competing thoughts filling my brain. One was. Another, tickling my
brain with panicked feathery bird wings, went something like: <em>Lola
Lola Lola you have lost Lola</em>. It was hard to concentrate on
Jason&rsquo;s story. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>But I guess I got
the gist, because when he finished, I had a new thought, and this
was: <em>Carl doesn&rsquo;t sound that crazy.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Charlie
realizes Carl doesn&rsquo;t sound that insane. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; He talks
to his legs &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Charlie
should vomit. Only it&rsquo;s not food. He should still feel weepy
about what he has become. He&rsquo;s separating from his parts. And
BF is trying to bundle him out the door as quickly as possible. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Releasing
a cat to catch a mouse... releasing a dog to catch the cat. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Lola&rsquo;s
heart is running out &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; I felt
nervous. I felt sick. I felt angry. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, let
them look at your head,&rdquo; said one of Cautery&rsquo;s
assistants. &ldquo;It could be fractured.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t
find a way to phrase the question that wasn&rsquo;t insane. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> why...&rdquo; The
question felt too big to fit through my brain. &ldquo;Why did you
think I&rsquo;d want a <em>gun on my arm</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>One time in
college, I tried to buy a pack of Doritos from a vending machine. I
fed my bills into the slot, pressed C (firmly) then 4 (firmly), and
waited. Nothing happened, so I pressed C-4 again (more firmly). Still
nothing. I tried CANCEL, thinking to start over, and the machine
whirred, the steel coil revolved, and the Doritos packet edged
closer, then stuck there.</p>
<p>I cursed and kicked
it, because I was 22 and there were people watching. I said, &ldquo;This
<em>stupid</em> machine.&rdquo; It was humiliating to be defeated by an
inanimate object, especially one designed to do what I wanted.</p>
<p>As I stared at the
dangling Doritos packet, a different way of looking at the situation
occurred to me. In this scenario, the vending machine was intelligent
and I was a machine. The vending machine, for reasons of its own&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s important to know the vending machine&rsquo;s
motivation, but say it was bored&mdash;poked my buttons in order to
elicit particular behaviors. This scenario made sense because if you
replaced me with a different human being they would have acted the
same way. There was nothing unique or unpredictable about me getting
mad; an intelligent vending machine would know that&rsquo;s what
humans do when you dangle snacks in front of them.</p>
<p><A NAME="firstHeading1"></A>I
spent the rest of the day trying to think why an objective observor
should believe I was controlling the vending machine in this
situation and not the other way around. And
I couldn&rsquo;t. I had a brain and the vending machine didn&rsquo;t,
but that was classic
anthropocentrism: for all I
knew, the vending machine&rsquo;s consciousness resided in a space I
didn&rsquo;t understand. It might argue I couldn&rsquo;t have
consciousness because I didn&rsquo;t have a coin slot. 
</p>
<p>That was when I
decided there wasn&rsquo;t much difference between humans and
machines. We&rsquo;re more complex, of course, but it&rsquo;s a
distinction of degrees, not difference. We&rsquo;re all vending
machines.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Since then, I have
increasingly believed that human beings are inherently predictable.
Threaten us with harm and we run away. Warm us and we relax. Offer us
six hundred dollars a week if we sit at a desk and answer phone
calls, and we will sit at a desk and answer phone calls. We are more
complex than vending machines, of course. But the distinction is of
degrees, not difference. Give me infinite computing power and perfect
knowledge of environmental variables, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can
model consciousness. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that one day, not too far
from now, we will have definitive proof that we are all vending
machines.</p>

<p>The steel felt
freezing. 
</p>
<p>looked okay, but
many of the other people had sooty faces</p>

<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Legs
online: he feels them. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery
had not been lying about the improved tactile feedback</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; drugs make
him happy&mdash;the <em>make </em>him, appropriate term because he is
now comprised of drugs &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>At first I missed
the last word; I thought he said, These drugs will make you, and was
confused, although then I thought that that was probably accurate. I
was made of drugs.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; you flood
my brain with endorphins and I become a different person &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Ending: I
could feel them. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>That was what was
different about the Threes. I could feel them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each
glistening raindrop that fell in her hair was a shimmering sphere of
boundless possibility.
