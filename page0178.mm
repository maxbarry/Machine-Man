<p>In my head, I
stomped. I created a shock wave that rippled through the concrete and
tossed Jason into the air. It knocked Cassandra Cautery to the
ground. People shouted. Jason scrambled on hands and knees toward the
device, but I was faster, and crushed it under one hoof. I didn&rsquo;t
even have to kick over the van: the guards scattered, knowing what I
could do. In the moment before they rallied, I ran to Lola and swept
her up in my arms. We leapt from the parking garage and landed in the
alley. There were police cruisers, ambulances, cops with guns, but I
powered past them. I ran until they were all far behind me, until I
was beyond Better Future&rsquo;s digital reach. Before dawn, in
another city, we broke into an electronics store and used their
equipment to locate the part of me that transmitted. I taught Lola
how to use a magnetic drill and she straddled my chest and made sure
we could never be found again.</p>
<p>This was a good
plan, in my head.</p>
<p>I raised a hoof.
That was as far as I got. It hung there, suspended. It did not feel
any different. It did not deaden, as the gun-arm had earlier. But it
did not listen to me. I was a statue. I looked at Lola, because I
wanted her to be the last thing I saw before oxygen starvation hit my
brain, and began to choke up, because now I was going to die and miss
everything. But I did not die, either. I just stood there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get him in
the vehicle,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;Hurry.&rdquo;
Jason poked at his device. My hoof came down. My other leg jerked
forward. I was not a statue. I was a puppet.</p>
