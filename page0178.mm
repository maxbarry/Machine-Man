<p>In my head, I
stomped my hoof. I created a shock wave that rippled through the
concrete and tossed Jason into the air. Cassandra Cautery fell to the
ground with a cry. People shouted. The power loader overturned. Jason
scrambled on hands and knees toward the device he&rsquo;d lost, but I
was faster. I crushed it under one hoof. I didn&rsquo;t even have to
kick over the van: the guards scattered, knowing what I could do. I
ran back and swept up Lola in one arm. We leaped out of the parking
garage and landed in the alley. There were police cruisers there, and
ambulances, but I powered past them all. I ran until we had left them
all behind. I ran so far Better Future&rsquo;s wireless control
couldn&rsquo;t reach me. One night, in another city, I broke into an
electronics store and used their equipment to locate every part of me
that looked like it transmitted. I taught Lola how to use a magnetic
drill and she straddled my chest and made sure Better Future could
never find us again.</p>
<p>This was a good
plan, in my head.</p>
<p>I raised one leg.
But it did not come down. It did not feel any different. It didn&rsquo;t
deaden, like the gun-arm had earlier. But it did not listen to me. I
was a statue. I looked at Lola, because I wanted her to be the last
thing I saw before the oxygen starvation hit my brain. I started to
cry, because now I was going to die, and miss everything. But I did
not die, either. I just stood there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now get him
into the van,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. Jason poked at his
device. My hoof came down. My other leg took a step forward. And I
realized it was worse.</p>
