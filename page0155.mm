<p>&ldquo;He came in
through the lobby,&rdquo; said Jason. Cassandra Cautery had left,
presumably to have that cut attended to. &ldquo;Which I think was
something of a surprise to everyone here because, well, there are a
lot of entrances and a security guard knows them all. Of course, we
had people in the lobby. We had snipers on the roof, we had guys in
mounted Hummers. We deployed some weaponry from the Speculative
Military Products people that I don&rsquo;t even think is out of
prototype. There was a sonic gun in the underground parking lot, the
back lawn was sown with EMP mines, they did that weeks ago, and the
lobby guys set up a... well, I guess it was an electroshock cannon.
Like a big tazer, firing a couple hundred electrified darts a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Carl
turns up. And&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if anyone told you this, but
the reason things turned ugly with Carl, it was because he was trying
to steal stuff. He was sneaking parts and equipment out of the
building. I don&rsquo;t know what a guy wants with multiple sets of
hands, but...&rdquo; His eyes flicked at me, then away. &ldquo;Anyway,
one of the things Carl took was a Fiber Shield. I don&rsquo;t know if
nobody noticed it missing, or they just figured Carl wouldn&rsquo;t
deploy it, or what. But he did. He turned up and threw down the
shield and they shot at him and that&rsquo;s what happened.&rdquo; He
studied my face. &ldquo;You went to the presentation on the Fiber
Shield, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. It&rsquo;s,
um, essentially a bomb. It throws out this fog of tiny fiber strips,
like ribbons. They&rsquo;re harmless, but they float in the air,
millions of them, and their ends are sticky. The idea is that when
someone shoots into that fog, the bullet hits a ribbon and the ribbon
sticks to it. Now it&rsquo;s not balanced, so it gets pulled
off-course. It might go left, right, who knows. The point is it&rsquo;s
diverted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This
presentation, they showed how it&rsquo;s almost impossible to hit a
target twenty feet behind the fog. They did five or six test shots,
and each one missed. Some missed by a lot. It was pretty cool. It&rsquo;s
not really guaranteed protection, you know, like I wouldn&rsquo;t
want to stake my life on it, because the amount of diversion depends
on how many ribbons the bullet hits, the angle at each collision, all
these random variables. The project leader, that&rsquo;s Caroline
Edwards, who did that really interesting paper on creating disruptive
resonance in inner ear fluid, if you saw that... oh, well, Caroline
said, you fire enough bullets, eventually one will go straight. So
maybe that&rsquo;s what the security guys were thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Carl
turns up on the front lawn. He sets off that bomb, and everyone
starts shooting. I was in the lab, watching on CCTV. There are
literally like fifty guys pouring out gunfire, and maybe that would
have been okay, but the guys on the electroshock cannon start
shooting, too, and they fill the air with million-volt darts. Those
darts, they&rsquo;re a lot lighter than bullets, so they hit the fog
and go <em>everywhere</em>. They&rsquo;re hitting our own guys, they&rsquo;re
starting fires, they&rsquo;re landing on the roof. Then a Hummer
takes a hit in the fuel tank and it&rsquo;s chaos, nothing but smoke
and fire and people yelling, and Carl does what he likes.&rdquo;</p>
