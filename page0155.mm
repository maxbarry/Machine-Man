<p>&ldquo;He came in
through the lobby,&rdquo; said Jason. An escalating number of people
were doing things I didn&rsquo;t understand to body parts I&rsquo;d
only just gained, like mechanics in a pit stop, but Jason&rsquo;s job
seemed to be to talk me through this. &ldquo;Which I think was
something of a surprise to everyone here, because, well, there are
several entrances, and a security guard knows them all. Of course, we
had people in the lobby. We had snipers on the roof, we had guys in
mounted Hummers. We deployed weaponry from the Speculative Military
Products people I&rsquo;m sure isn&rsquo;t out of prototype. There
was a sonics gun in the underground parking lot, the back lawn was
sown with EMP mines, and the lobby guys had... well, I guess it was
an electroshock cannon. Like a tazer, only firing a couple hundred
darts a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Carl
turns up. And&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if anyone told you this, but
the reason things turned ugly with Carl, it was because he was
stealing stuff. He was sneaking parts out of the building. I don&rsquo;t
know what a guy wants with multiple sets of hands, but...&rdquo; He
cleared his throat. &ldquo;Anyway, one of the things Carl took was a
Fiber Shield. And clearly nobody really planned out all the
contingencies, because when Carl turned up, he used it, and they shot
at him, and that&rsquo;s what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He studied my face.
&ldquo;You went to the Fiber Shield presentation, didn&rsquo;t you?
It&rsquo;s, um, essentially a bomb. It throws out a fog of tiny fiber
strips, micro-ribbons. They&rsquo;re harmless, but they float in the
air, millions or billions of them, and their ends are sticky. If
someone shoots into that fog, the bullet hits a ribbon and the ribbon
sticks to it. It gets unbalanced, pulled off-course. It might go
left, right, who knows. The point is it diverts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This
presentation, they showed how it&rsquo;s almost impossible to hit a
target standing twenty feet behind the fog. They did five or six test
shots, and each one missed. Some missed by a lot. It was pretty cool.
It&rsquo;s not really guaranteed protection, you know, like I
wouldn&rsquo;t want to stake my life on it, because the amount of
diversion depends on how many ribbons the bullet hits, the angle at
each collision, all these random variables. The project leader,
that&rsquo;s Abeline Knudsen, who did that really interesting paper
on creating disruptive resonances in inner ear fluid, if you saw
that... well, she said, you fire enough bullets, eventually one will
go straight. Or straight enough. So, actually thinking about it now,
maybe that&rsquo;s what they told the security guys. If he throws
down the Fiber Shield, pour bullets into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Carl
turns up on the front lawn. He sets off that bomb, and everyone opens
fire. I&rsquo;m in the lab, watching on CCTV, and there are guys
everywhere, gushing gunfire. And maybe that would have been okay, but
the electroshock cannon guys open fire, too, and fill the air with
million-volt darts. These darts are a lot lighter than bullets, so
they hit the fog and they go <em>everywhere</em>. They&rsquo;re hitting
our own guys, they&rsquo;re landing on the roof, they&rsquo;re
sparking and starting fires. Then a Hummer takes a hit in the fuel
tank and it&rsquo;s chaos, nothing but smoke and fire and people
screaming, and Carl does what he likes.&rdquo;</p>
