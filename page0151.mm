<p>Faces appeared.
They were grim faces, stained with soot, riding atop green scrubs and
gray uniforms. They had hands, which reached for my body and tried to
guide it back toward the operating theater. &ldquo;Come on, Dr.
Neumann,&rdquo; said Jason, like I was a dog. &ldquo;This way. Come
on.&rdquo; His eyes were red. His lab coat was torn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a guy... hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
take care of it.&rdquo; Jason took hold of my shoulder, the whole
one, and tried to steer me. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you back on the
table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
It wasn&rsquo;t that I didn&rsquo;t trust him. I was just confused.
We re-entered the operating theater, and two surgeons or paramedics
or whatever they were moved to the man in green scrubs. &ldquo;Is
that guy dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the
table,&rdquo; said Jason. Several of the people nearby began a
discussion about the water falling everywhere; they were against it.
A man began trying to sop up the bloodbath that was the table with
plainly inadequate towels.. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re missing an arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt a sharp pain
in my shoulder and turned to see a woman plunging the contents of a
syringe into my veins. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Before I
reached the end of this sentence, I wanted to kiss her. She was
beautiful and shiny and full of love. Everything was. It was a very
good drug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Neumann.
On to the table, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re
kind of handsome,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget the
table,&rdquo; said the man who was no longer sopping. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
too wet. Just get him to stand there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just stand
here, please, Dr. Neumann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;
The rain stopped. People said: <em>Ahhh</em>. My legs felt cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As still as
you can. We&rsquo;re going to do what we can here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My legs are
cold.&rdquo; I leaned forward, to see them. People who were trying to
do something to my planed shoulder yelped and told me not to do that.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re
wet,&rdquo; Jason said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably evaporation. Oh,
wait. I see what you mean. Yes. We improved the tactile interface. I
thought Cassandra Cautery told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had. I just
hadn&rsquo;t thought about what it meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you
never prioritized sensory feedback. But while you were gone, we found
it really enhanced the user experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reached down with
bloody fingers and touched my thigh. The metal felt cold. My fingers
felt electric. I could not honestly say they felt like fingers. But
they felt. They felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a lot of
respects, it&rsquo;s totally crude. We&rsquo;re transmitting maybe a
tenth of the full spectrum of nerve sensation. But still. It&rsquo;s
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had been right,
before. The thing that was different about the Threes, it was
everything. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>
