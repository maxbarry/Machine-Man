<p>&ldquo;So there we were,&rdquo; Lola
said. &ldquo;Me with a new heart and my parents wiped out again. This
time, I&rsquo;d taken down my grandparents as well. I mean, I didn&rsquo;t
know that at the time. I found all this out later. The retirement
plans that had been canceled. The homes and heirlooms that had been
sold. All so I could have my stop-gap heart. And four years to go
until I needed a new one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then one day, a few weeks later,
I&rsquo;m on the sofa watching TV and my mom gets this call. Her
face, it goes slack, and she grabs at the wall, like somebody&rsquo;s
pushing her over. Because it&rsquo;s my dad&rsquo;s work on the
phone. He&rsquo;s been in an accident. Dad, he worked in an auto
assembly plant. Not on the floor. He was an engineer. But this day
he&rsquo;d been down there, and one of the robots caught his hand. It
welded his hand to a car door. The foreman, when he visited us at the
hospital, he kept saying he couldn&rsquo;t understand how it
happened. There were supposed to be safeties. They were actually one
of the things Dad was in charge of. So it was a little ironic. I
mean, it seemed ironic. Before we found out it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They amputated Dad&rsquo;s hand
at the wrist. When he came home, he had a check for fifty thousand
dollars. The auto workers union, they&rsquo;d negotiated a standard
payment schedule with the company for injury&mdash;a set amount you
got, regardless of fault, if you were permanently injured on the job.
You lose your left hand, like Dad, you automatically get fifty
thousand. A thumb on the dominant hand is twenty grand. Big toes are
ten each. The little ones, three grand a pop. Loss of hearing is
worth ten grand. Forty if it&rsquo;s total. Each foot, forty
thousand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask me how I know this,&rdquo;
Lola said. &ldquo;How I know all these amounts.&rdquo;</p>
