<p>&ldquo;So there we were,&rdquo; said
Lola. &ldquo;Me with an expensive new heart and my parents wiped out
again. This time I took down my grandparents as well. I mean, I
didn&rsquo;t know that at the time. I found all this out later. The
retirement plans that had been shelved, the homes and heirlooms that
had been sold. All so I could have my stop-gap heart. And maybe five
years at the outside until I needed a new one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few weeks later, I&rsquo;m on
the sofa watching TV and my mom gets this call. Her face, it goes
tight, and she grabs at the wall, like somebody&rsquo;s pushing her
over. Because it&rsquo;s my dad&rsquo;s work on the phone. He&rsquo;s
been in an accident. Dad worked in an auto assembly plant. Not on the
floor. He was an engineer. But this day he&rsquo;d been down there
and one of the robots caught his hand. You know. The robots that make
the cars. Somehow this one welded his hand to a car door. The
foreman, when he visited us, he kept saying he couldn&rsquo;t
understand how it happened. There were all kinds of safeties. They
were actually one of the things Dad was in charge of. So it was a
little ironic. I mean, it seemed ironic. Before we found out it
wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They amputated Dad&rsquo;s hand
at the wrist. When he came home, he had a check for fifty thousand
dollars. The auto workers union, they&rsquo;d negotiated a standard
payment schedule with the company for injury&mdash;a set amount you
got if you were permanently disabled on the job, regardless of fault.
You lose your left hand, like Dad, you automatically get fifty
thousand. A thumb on the dominant hand, that&rsquo;s twenty grand.
Big toes are ten each. The little ones, three grand a pop. Loss of
hearing is worth ten grand, forty if it&rsquo;s total. Each foot,
forty thousand dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask me how I know this,&rdquo;
Lola said. &ldquo;How I know all these amounts.&rdquo;</p>
