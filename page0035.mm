<p>Each stride of the Contours, my neck stretched so far back my head
felt ready to pop right off. When each foot slammed down, my chin hit
my chest hard enough to crack teeth. Through eyes blurred with tears,
I saw a busy street approaching and thought: <em>Oh thank God now they
will stop.</em> But they didn&rsquo;t. They ran into the traffic. A
sedan whipped by so close its turbulence tore at my hair. A truck the
size of a building loomed above me, and I heard a terrified shriek,
and realized it was me. There was a clicking deep within the
Contours, something I felt rather than heard, and they stopped. I was
about to die, I realized. I was about to learn why you didn&rsquo;t
conduct the first live field test of new technology while strapped to
the top of it. This truck would run right over the top of me, and
when it stopped and the driver climbed out, he would find a long
bloody smear leading to a gleaming, undamaged pair of titanium legs.
It would be the ultimate vindication of my work, proving the
superiority of artificial body parts. But also the need for
comprehensive bug-testing.</p>
<p>The legs bent and sprang. I screamed like a child. The truck,
traffic, and road grew small and far away. I let go of the seat to
flail my arms, as if I could grab the air somehow, or fly. My upward
velocity slowed, and then for the briefest moment I was flying,
moving leisurely forward sixty feet above the ground. It was kind of
beautiful. Then I began to fall. The world grew rapidly larger and
more dangerous. As it rushed toward me, my brain informed me: <em>Forty
miles per hour, an object dropped from sixty feet has a final
velocity of forty miles per hour</em>. That was not helping.</p>
<p>On the sidewalk below, a woman and her young son gaped up at me, this
strange man falling from the sky. At first it seemed a terrible
coincidence, these two standing right where I was about to land, and
then I realized it wasn&rsquo;t. It was planned. My legs saw these
people as cushioning: physical objects that could help absorb the
shock of my impact. I had programmed them to avoid collisions on a
horizontal plane, but anything lower than they were was fair game:
considered to be ground. It had seemed a reasonable assumption at the
time, in the lab.</p>
