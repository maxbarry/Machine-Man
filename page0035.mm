<p>My legs stopped at a busy intersection somewhere south of downtown. I
didn&rsquo;t know where, exactly. All I knew was they had been
running for ten minutes and I had been hanging on, begging them not
to run me under a bus. The Contours, like all my legs, had been
subjected to some pretty rigorous quality assurance, but even so, I
hadn&rsquo;t planned on conducting their first live field test while
strapped to the top of them. I had faith in technology, but I didn&rsquo;t
expect it to be bug-free. Not ever.</p>
<p>I had gotten some pretty alarmed looks over the last ten minutes, and
some screaming and fleeing out of the way, but now, as I stood
swaying and sweating on the corner, people barely glanced at me. A
woman with her young son put one hand on his shoulder to steer him
away from me; that was all. I realized my tie hung over my shoulder
like a tongue, my shirt was dripping, my jacket hanging half-off one
arm. I looked like a hobo. And I started to laugh, a crazy,
high-pitched sound I couldn&rsquo;t control, because my legs had
stopped, and the world was getting back to normal, and that had been
the most out-of-control freaking ten minutes of my life.</p>
