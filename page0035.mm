<p>I was going to fly off my legs like a rodeo rider. Each stride of the
Contours, I was sure my head was about to pop off my ridiculously
stretched neck, and when each foot slammed down, my chin hit my chest
hard enough to crack teeth. Through eyes blurred with tears, I saw a
busy street approaching and thought: <em>Oh thank God they will stop.</em>
But they didn&rsquo;t: they ran into the traffic. A sports car&mdash;a
Dodge Viper?&mdash;whipped by so close its turbulence tore at my
hair. Then I was in the next lane, a truck the size of a building
bearing down. I heard a shriek, and realized it was me. There was a
clicking deep within the Contours, something I felt rather than
heard, and they stopped. I was about to die, I realized. I was about
to learn why you didn&rsquo;t conduct the first live field test of
new technology while strapped to the top of it. This truck would run
over the top of me, and when it stopped and the driver climbed out,
he would find a long bloody smear leading to a gleaming, undamaged
pair of titanium legs. It would be the ultimate vindication of my
work, proving beyond all doubt the superiority of artificial body
parts. But also the need for comprehensive bug-testing.</p>
<p>The legs bent and sprang. I screamed like a child. The truck,
traffic, and road grew small and far away. I let go of the seat to
flail my arms, as if I could grab the air somehow, or fly. My upward
velocity slowed, and then for the briefest moment I was flying,
moving leisurely forward sixty feet above the ground. It was kind of
beautiful. Then I began to fall. The world grew rapidly larger and
more dangerous. As it rushed toward me, my brain informed me: <em>Forty
miles per hour, an object dropped from sixty feet has a final
velocity of forty miles per hour</em>, and that was not helping.</p>
<p>On the sidewalk below, a woman and her young son stood gaping at me,
this strange man falling from the sky. At first it seemed a terrible
coincidence, these two standing where I was about to intersect the
ground, and then I realized it was not. To my legs, these people were
cushioning: physical objects that could help absorb the shock of my
impact. I had not programmed them to distinguish between people and
things. They would avoid collisions with things on a horizontal
plane, but anything lower than they were was an exeption: considered
to be ground. It had seemed a reasonable assumption at the time, in
the lab.</p>
