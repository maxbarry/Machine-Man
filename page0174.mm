<h5>CHAPTER 
THIRTY-SIX</h5>
<p>&ldquo;I love you,
Charlie,&rdquo; Lola said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not sure how much you
is in there any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stared at Carl.
This didn&rsquo;t seem to be a trick. His chest did not rise or fall.
He genuinely appeared to be non-living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you
took a bad turn,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Because at first you were
making yourself better. You were. But then it kind of took you over.
I realized that a while ago, Charlie, at Angelica&rsquo;s. When your
legs stopped working, I thought, well, maybe that&rsquo;s not such a
bad thing. Maybe it would let you be you again. But... well, look at
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carl was off. He
was non-functional. He was disabled. He was dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just want
to go back to how things were before. I mean... can&rsquo;t we do
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sirens were
very loud now. Then they stopped. Somewhere below us, I heard
engines, voices. I turned to face Lola, and reflected blue light was
flickering across her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not against self-improvement,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I just think
you&rsquo;ve gone backward.&rdquo;</p>
