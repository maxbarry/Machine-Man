<p>The mother yanked her son&rsquo;s arm. This kid was no toddler: he
was seven or eight at least. I have seen women wrestling with
children of this age before, in supermarket aisles and parking lots,
and usually the kids don&rsquo;t budge. But apparently a man falling
out of the sky like a missile changed everything, because when the
mother pulled this kid&rsquo;s arm, he flew through the air like he
was hollow. It was a convincing example of the strength-boosting
properties of adrenaline, I thought.</p>
<p>My legs could not correct my flight path to use the boy or his mother
as shock absorbers, and so I impacted the sidewalk beside them. The
concrete split beneath my metal feet. Dust burst into the air. My
spine bent in a way that felt very, very wrong. I lost all my breath,
then sucked in a lungful of dust. I felt the legs moving beneath me,
and tried to tell them to wait a second, because I had to apologize
to the mother and son, to make sure they were okay, and so was I. But
the Contours didn&rsquo;t care. Their world was defined by a location
and a destination and the optimum path between the two; everything
else was a waste of time.

<p>, which choked me. The legs were already moving: as far as they were
concerned, 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I wanted to apologize, to the boy and his mother, but the force of
impact drove all breath from my body, and when I inhaled, I got a
mouthful of dust and started coughing. 
</p>
<p>Concrete dust burst into the air</p>
<p>I tried to gasp out an apology, but all breath 
</p>
<p>and shrank about three feet. The Contours were good like that: they 
</p>
<p>Add a man falling out of the sky like a missile aimed at their
offspring&rsquo;s heart, though, and suddenly that kid is airborne.</p>
<p>But she pulled him through the air like he was hollow. Because 
</p>
<p>My legs had no way of knowing otherwise; I hadn&rsquo;t given them
the programming. They were programmed to not run into things. But

<p>My legs stopped at a busy intersection somewhere south of downtown. I
didn&rsquo;t know where, exactly. All I knew was they had been
running for ten minutes and I had been hanging on, begging them not
to run me under a bus. The Contours, like all my legs, had been
subjected to some pretty rigorous quality assurance, but even so, I
hadn&rsquo;t planned on conducting their first live field test while
strapped to the top of them. I had faith in technology, but I didn&rsquo;t
expect it to be bug-free. Not ever.</p>
<p>I had gotten some pretty alarmed looks over the last ten minutes, and
some screaming and fleeing, but now, as I stood swaying and sweating
on the corner, people barely glanced at me. A woman with her young
son put one hand on his shoulder to steer him around me; that was
all. I realized my tie hung over my shoulder like a tongue, my shirt
was dripping, my jacket hanging half-off one arm. I looked like a
hobo. And I started to laugh, a crazy, high-pitched sound I couldn&rsquo;t
control, because my legs had stopped, and the world was getting back
to normal, and that had been the most out-of-control freaking ten
minutes of my life.</p>
