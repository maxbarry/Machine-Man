<p>Each stride of the Contours, my neck stretched so far back my head
felt ready to pop right off. When each foot slammed down, my chin hit
my chest hard enough to crack teeth. Through eyes blurred with tears,
I saw a busy street approaching and thought: <em>Oh thank God now they
will stop.</em> But they didn&rsquo;t. They ran into the traffic. A
sedan whipped by so close its turbulence tore at my hair. A truck the
size of a building loomed above me, and I heard a terrified shriek,
and realized it was me. There was a clicking deep within the
Contours, something I felt rather than heard, and they stopped. I was
about to die, I realized. I was about to learn why you didn&rsquo;t
conduct the first live field test of new technology while strapped to
the top of it. This truck would run right over the top of me, and
when it stopped and the driver climbed out, he would find a long
bloody smear leading to a gleaming, undamaged pair of titanium legs.
It would be the ultimate vindication of my work, proving the
superiority of artificial body parts. But also the need for
comprehensive bug-testing.</p>
<p>The legs bent and sprang. I screamed like a child. The truck,
traffic, and road grew small and far away. I let go of the seat to
flail my arms, as if I could grab the air, or fly. My upward velocity
slowed, and for the briefest moment I was flying, moving leisurely
forward sixty feet above the ground. It was kind of beautiful. Then I
began to fall. The world grew larger and more dangerous. As it rushed
toward me, my brain reckoned my terminal velocity at forty miles per
hour: that was how fast I would be going when I hit the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Below, a woman and her young son gaped up at me. At first it seemed a
terrible coincidence, them standing at the exact point I was destined
to intersect the sidewalk. Then I realized it wasn&rsquo;t. It was
calculated. My legs saw these people as cushioning: physical objects
that could help absorb the shock of impact. I had programmed them to
avoid collisions on a horizontal plane, but anything lower than they
were was considered ground. It had seemed a reasonable assumption at
the time, in the lab.</p>
