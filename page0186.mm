<h5>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h5>
<p>If you just read
this whole serial one freaking page at a time, thank you. There were
a lot of reasons this might not have worked, and the big one was: you
wouldn&rsquo;t want to come with me. And I wouldn&rsquo;t have blamed
you. This story was straight from my fingers to your brain, with no
time for reflection or rewriting in between, something that is a kind
of crime for a writer, or should be. When I re-read this thing, I&rsquo;ll
no doubt wince at the bumps and jolts I inflicted on you along the
way: thank you for making it here despite them.</p>
<p>The most strange
and wonderful part of this project for me was the feedback loop:
comments from readers kept me in touch with what you thought, threw
up ideas, and became a kind of meta-work (<em>The Annotated Machine
Man</em>). Thank you to everyone who contributed one! And special
thanks to those who contributed many, many comments, the most
prolific of whom were: Pev (still interesting), gStein, CrystalR,
Toby O, Electrichead, David, Ben, fredzfrog, Stygian Emperor,
Mapuche, coolpillows, Chemical Rascal (puns and haiku on demand),
Alex, Ian Manka, Felix, C Leffelman, SilverKnight, Yannick,
dabbeljuh, Abgrund, Alan Westbrook, SexCpotatoes, regtiangha,
Neville, Adam Speicher (a.k.a. meta-Adam), tim, Katie Ellert
(&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Lola? WHERE&rsquo;S LOLA?&rdquo;), Ajna, Isaac,
Joe M., Justin, towr, Morlok8k, Ballotonia, Sander, Ted, and Robert
Bissonnette. Many times I clicked through to the previous day&rsquo;s
comments with dread, sure that everybody had hated it, but found
instead cheers, jokes, and crazy spin-off ideas that buoyed me
forward. Before I began, I was tempted to put a warning on the
comments page, something like: &ldquo;Just so you know, being too
critical of this thing while I&rsquo;m still writing it will almost
certainly cause me to lock up completely.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t do
that and didn&rsquo;t have to. You were far nicer to me than I
deserved.</p>
<p>Thank
you to everyone who tossed me an idea: those were much appreciated,
and even the ones I didn&rsquo;t use helped me clarify the boundaries
of my story&rsquo;s world. The idea I liked most was from Meredith
Course, who educated me about brain plasticity and free-roaming
neurons: that one propelled many pages.</p>
<p>I also want to
mention Michael Ian Minter again. Now, I don&rsquo;t want to
encourage people to go around goading authors. Particularly when that
author is me. But Minter&rsquo;s kick in the pants essentially
decided me on doing this, and since I would have sheeted home the
blame to him had it gone spectacularly wrong, it&rsquo;s only fair I
thank him now.</p>
<p>Thank you to Jen
for her patience with me on those days I struggled with my daily
deadline (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not happy with my page. I have to redo my
<em>paaaaage</em>&rdquo;), and for telling me it sounded like a pretty
good idea to begin with. Ditto to my agent, Luke Janklow, who also
made sure this fun experiment in real-time fiction didn&rsquo;t break
me financially, by finding enthusiastic fans in Zachary Wagman of
Vintage Books, Aviva Tuffield of Scribe, and, with Brian Siberrel,
Cathy Schulman of Mandalay Pictures.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always
held a sneaking affection for the first draft. They are loose and
indulgent, scattered and silly, but also raw and passionate and
roguishly lovable. Mine usually amuse no-one but me, and then I have
to dismember them and re-arrange their parts for improved flow. I am
glad this one gets to live: that while it may soon have a bigger,
better-looking brother (one less prone to unexpected mood shifts and
thoughtlessness, less likely to knock things over or step on your
dog), this one got to leave the house, and spend some time in your
brain.</p>
