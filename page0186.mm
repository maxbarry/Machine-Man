<p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</p>
<p>You there. Yeah,
you. Thanks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of the most
interesting parts of this project was the comments: they kept me in
touch with what readers thought, threw up ideas, and became a kind of
meta-work: &ldquo;The Annotated Machine Man,&rdquo; maybe. Thank you
to everyone who contributed a comment. And special thanks to those
who contributed many, many comments, the most prolific of whom were:
Pev (still interesting), gStein, CrystalR, Toby O, Electrichead,
David, Ben, fredzfrog, Stygian Emperor, Mapuche, Chemical Rascal
(haiku on demand), coolpillows, Alex, Ian Manka, Felix , C Leffelman,
SilverKnight, Yannick, dabbeljuh, Abgrund, Alan Westbrook,
SexCpotatoes, regtiangha, Neville, Adam, tim, Katie Ellert (&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
Lola? WHERE&rsquo;S LOLA?&rdquo;), Ajna, Isaac, Joe M., Justin, towr,
Morlok8k, Ballotonia, Sander, and Robert Bissonnette. Many times I
clicked through to the previous day&rsquo;s comments with a sense of
dread, the growing suriety that everybody had surely hated it, but I
was always (almost always) instead met with cheers, jokes, and crazy
spin-off ideas that buouyed me forward. Before I began, I was tempted
to put a warning on the comments page, something like: &ldquo;Just so
you know, being too critical of this thing while I&rsquo;m still
writing it may cause me to lock up completely.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t
do that, and didn&rsquo;t have to. You were all far nicer to me than
I deserved.</p>
<p>I also want to
mention Michael Ian Minter again. Now, I don&rsquo;t want to
encourage people to go around goading authors, particularly when that
author is me, but Minter&rsquo;s kick in the pants essentially
decided me on doing this. And since I would have fully sheeted home
the blame to him had it all gone spectacularly wrong, it&rsquo;s only
fair I thank him now.</p>
<p>Thank you to Jen
for her patience with me on those days I struggled with my deadline
(&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not happy with my page. I have to redo my
<em>paaaaage</em>&rdquo;), and for telling me it sounded like a pretty
good idea to begin with. Ditto for my agent, Luke Janklow, who also
made sure this fun experiment in real-time fiction didn&rsquo;t break
me financially, finding fans in Zachary Wagman of Vintage Books and,
with Brian Siberrel, Cathy Schulman of Mandalay Pictures.</p>
