<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
killed him.&rdquo; Cassandra Cautery stepped carefully over the
broken glass, braced herself against what was left of the window
frame, and peered down. &ldquo;Look at him. He&rsquo;s just lying
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to say: <em>I
didn&rsquo;t mean to</em>. But my chest was compressing my lungs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That guy is
dead.&rdquo; There was a touch of awe in her voice. &ldquo;He is
definitely dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Against my better
judgment, I took another look. Most of the space between Better
Future and the road was occupied by a wide, healthy lawn. It looked
soft. But it was bisected by a narrow concrete path, and on this lay
the Manager. I am tempted to claim this as really bad luck, but given
his position, I couldn&rsquo;t honestly say he would have survived if
he&rsquo;d landed on the grass. I couldn&rsquo;t see his head.</p>
<p>My legs took a step
forward, surprising me. It brought me right to the edge. It was as if
my legs wanted to have a look at what they had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,
Charlie,&rdquo; Cassandra Cautery murmured. Her eyes didn&rsquo;t
leave the Manager. &ldquo;You are in so very, very much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My legs tensed.
Four key sections contracted two inches. I felt scared and confused,
because I hadn&rsquo;t asked them to do this. And maybe it was a fear
reaction: maybe my terrified brain was barfing out static that the
Contours misread. But it didn&rsquo;t feel like that. It felt like
they were making decisions on their own.</p>
<p>Behind me, someone
screamed. I didn&rsquo;t have to turn to see that picture: the
Manager&rsquo;s beautiful assistant, one hand on the door handle, the
other flying to her mouth, shocked eyes wide, drinking in the scene.
I didn&rsquo;t have to hang around to know what happened next. My
legs were right, I realized. They had summarized the situation faster
than I had. I let them do it, and we jumped.</p>
