<h5>CHAPTER 
THIRTY</h5>
<p>I became aware of
smoke. I felt alarmed, in some small, sectioned-off part of my body.
Smoke is rarely good. In my line of work, it signals stupidity:
failure to adequately anticipate logical consquences, or check a
tolerance, or convert from imperial. This smoke was curling along the
ceiling above me. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what it signaled. I wasn&rsquo;t
sure where I was. I just knew there was smoke.</p>
<p><em>Get up</em>,
said the part of me that was worried about the smoke. But another
part said: <em>Lie here a little longer</em>,
and that felt more persuasive. I was doped. I was relaxed. I would
never feel this peaceful again, not without chemical assistance. I
had to savor it.</p>
<p>Something
was slooshing. It sounded soothing. Something else went: <em>Sssssss</em>,
like an old man easing into a favorite chair. I felt wet. I felt
safe. I was in the womb. The only thing that ruined it was the smoke,
which was becoming quite thick. But I could ignore that. I closed my
eyes.</p>
<p>Someone
coughed. I opened my eyes again, because that was a disconcerting
sound to hear in a womb. Especially this cough, which sounded wet. I
waited, hoping it would go away, but it didn&rsquo;t. <em>Cark.
Cark</em>. It was weak and kind of
perfunctory. Like the owner didn&rsquo;t expect it to do much good.</p>
<p>I was pondering the
implications of this, in a languid, Zen sort of way, when it began to
rain. Or rather, water droplets began to fall on my body. I decided
this was probably not rain because I could see the ceiling. I felt my
dream-state dissolving, and felt sad. But also better, because I
could feel myself coming back. My thoughts began to organize
themselves. I needed to sit up and see what the hell was going on.</p>
