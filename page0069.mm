<h5>CHAPTER 
FIFTEEN</h5>
<p>I followed Lola
into the recovery room and there he was. Carl. He sat on the edge of
the bed, naked except for boxer shorts, flexing his arm. By which I
mean <em>my</em> arm. It was the Protector: three independent axes of
rotation, lots of exposed steel. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>To his credit, Carl
looked mildly ashamed to see me. I would like to think he
appreciated, at least on some level, that what he had done here was
steal from me. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>, Carl, propped up
on pillows. A sheet covered him up to his stomach. Above this, he was
naked except for the bandages. 
</p>
<p>down. : above this,
naked flesh. Carl.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I had to say, Carl
was ripped. He had muscles in places I&rsquo;d only seen in anatomy
textbooks. It didn&rsquo;t make sense to me that somebody who put
this much work into their body would want to hack parts of it off,
but he seemed cheerful enough, giving me a tight grin as I walked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Carl,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Lola went straight
to him and knelt down. &ldquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Can
I talk to you a second?&rdquo;</p>
