<h5>CHAPTER 
FIFTEEN</h5>
<p>I followed Lola
into the recovery room and there he was: Carl, sitting on the edge of
the bed, naked but for boxer shorts, flexing his arm. By which I mean
<em>my</em> arm. He was strapped into a Flexor: three feet long, very
thin, hollow bands of delicate al-titanium alloy foil rods on four
ball joints with independent axes of rotation. Its main advantage was
it could reach in any direction, including behind you, and supported
a variety of different hands. It also weighed only ten pounds, ideal
for the user who hadn&rsquo;t yet upgraded the load-bearing capacity
of his spine. It was essentially a trainer arm. But this did not
change the fact that Carl should not have it.</p>
<p>To his credit, he
looked mildly ashamed. He stopped moving the arm, and his eyes
shifted from mine, then back, and then his lips twitched, as if he
wanted to smile, but thought maybe that would piss me off. This was a
good call. Because in this moment, it was everything I could do not
to kick Carl through the wall.</p>
