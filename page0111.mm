<p>(WED)</p>
<p>Angelica arrived
home around six. By then I was not doing so well. Every muscle in my
body felt made of glass. My bowels were panicked and easily startled.
I was sick of almost accidentally stepping on tiny scampering dogs
every time I went to the bathroom and beginning to fantasize about
doing it on purpose.</p>
<p>The dogs heard
Angelica&rsquo;s approach before I did and went into a frenzy,
barking, running laps of the hallway, and pawing at the door. When
Angelica appeared, she dropped to her knees and scooped up as many as
she could hold, laughing as they squirmed and licked her face. I
found the whole scene kind of disgraceful. I mean, I understand it
must be nice to be greeted this way, but have some dignity. You don&rsquo;t
need to roll over and expose your genitals. I&rsquo;m talking about
the dogs. Devotion that slavish becomes meaningless, in my opinion.
Call me a cat person, but there&rsquo;s no value in being worshiped
by beings with no self-respect. I have a similar issue with religion.</p>
<p>Angelica had with
her a large blue bag, which she had set down on the floorboards to
cuddle her dogs. This was one of those situations with social rules
so obvious even I could see them: I should give Angelica a minute
with her dogs before asking if that bag had painkillers in it and if
so could I please have some. So I did it: I waited silently at the
end of the hall, every biological part of my body screaming for
relief. Finally Angelica looked up. &ldquo;You need some meds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I guess the
sweating and grimacing gave it away. I said, &ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo;</p>
