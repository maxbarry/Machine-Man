<h5>CHAPTER 
TWENTY-EIGHT</h5>
<p>The Better Future
guards bundled me into the back seat of the town car and slammed the
door. I noticed it wasn&rsquo;t locked, so I opened it again. A guard
looked down at me and pushed it closed. This repeated twice more. By
then he was frustrated and said, &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; I
felt satisfied, because the answer was: <em>Being trouble</em>. I
didn&rsquo;t need legs for that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that,&rdquo;
the driver said. My door locked with a <em>thunk</em>. He was watching
me in the rear view mirror. I had never seen him before in my life,
but this condescending look coming from a guy resting one foot on the
accelerator of a 240 horsepower vehicle made me want to hurt him.</p>
<p>The opposite door
opened. Cassandra Cautery slid her gray-skirted butt onto the leather
seat. &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; she said to the driver. As the car pulled
out, she twisted around to look out the rear window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
Lola? What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; I got no reply, so turned around
to see for myself. The white van doors slammed closed; immediately,
the vehicle lunged forward, peeling onto the road behind us. I could
see at least two gray-suited guards left behind, scuttling toward
Angelica&rsquo;s open garage. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery&rsquo;s
eyes moved onto me. I realized something: apart from Lola, Cautery
was the only person who ever looked at me with no hint of revulsion.
&ldquo;Your girlfriend killed your legs, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;
She threw one more glance out the back window. &ldquo;All right.
Let&rsquo;s catch you up.&rdquo;</p>
