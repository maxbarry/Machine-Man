<h5>CHAPTER 
TWENTY-EIGHT</h5>
<p>The Better Future
guards bundled me into the back seat of the town car and slammed the
door. I noticed it wasn&rsquo;t locked, so I opened it again. A guard
looked down at me and pushed it closed. This repeated twice more. By
then he was frustrated and said, &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; I
felt satisfied, because the answer was: <em>Being trouble</em>. I
didn&rsquo;t need legs for that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that,&rdquo;
the driver said. My door locked with a <em>thunk</em>. I saw his eyes

gray-uniformed guards were left behind, scuttling toward Angelica&rsquo;s
open garage. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery&rsquo;s
eyes moved onto me. I realized something: apart from Lola, Cautery
was the only person who ever looked at me with no hint of revulsion.
&ldquo;She ruined your legs, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;
While my mouth was dropping open with outrage, she checked out the
back window again. &ldquo;All right. Let&rsquo;s catch you up.&rdquo;</p>
