<p>&ldquo;You know the
weight of the equipment carried by the average modern soldier?&rdquo;
The Manager spread his palms. The light flooding in the window behind
him made this gesture vaguely Messiaiac. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hundred
and fifty pounds. That&rsquo;s your standard grunt. You start talking
specialists, some of those guys are lugging half that again. We can&rsquo;t
increase the lethality of our soldiers any further simply because
they can&rsquo;t carry anything else. It&rsquo;s become a
load-bearing exercise. That&rsquo;s modern warfare. A logistics
puzzle. And sure, tell me it&rsquo;s never been any different. Tell
me that throughout history, battles have been won on the back of
resource selection and co-ordination. And I&rsquo;ll agree with you,
Charlie, to a point. But let me say this. An army of soldiers who run
at fifty miles per hour, can leap sixty feet into the air, have
instant access to weaponry suitable for infantry, tanks, aircraft,
bunkers, whatever continency they encounter, and are encased in two
hundred pounds of armor&mdash;that army could kick some ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; upgrade
potential. Vendor lock-in. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Manager took a
step toward me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, from
your expression, Charlie, I suspect you didn&rsquo;t have a military
application in mind when you started. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>And let me say that
if you don&rsquo;t want to get involved in this area, you can stay
right out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>But the role of
someone like myself in all this is to figure out how we can get you
the funds you need. That is, figuring out who might pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to be a super-soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Manager and
Cassandra Cautery looked at each other. Cautery said, &ldquo;Of
course you don&rsquo;t, Charlie. No-one&rsquo;s suggesting that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then
what...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Picture
this,&rdquo; said the Manager. &ldquo;&lt;&lt;storming the beaches&gt;&gt;A
crack squadron of Marines, all wearing Contours. Equipped with Silver
Spines and Rotators. Every one of them, kitted out in the parts you
designed.&rdquo;</p>
