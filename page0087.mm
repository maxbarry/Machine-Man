<p>&ldquo;The
equipment carried by the average modern-day soldier weighs a hundred
fifty pounds.&rdquo; The Manager spread his palms. The light flooding
in the window behind him made this gesture vaguely Messianic. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
your standard grunt. You start talking specialists, some of them are
lugging half that again. We have equipment that could radically
increase their effectiveness, but they simply can&rsquo;t carry it.
War has become a load-bearing exercise. A logistics puzzle. And sure,
tell me it&rsquo;s never been any different. Tell me that throughout
history, battles have been won on the back of resource selection and
co-ordination. And I&rsquo;ll agree with you, Charlie, to a point.
But let me say this. An army of soldiers who run at fifty miles per
hour, leap twenty feet into the air, carry an inbuilt arsenal capable
of handling any contingency, and walk through enemy fire like it&rsquo;s
a summer rain&mdash;that army could do some damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie has
some interesting spine work in the pipeline,&rdquo; said Cassandra
Cautery. &ldquo;I should get you an updated report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll
tell you what really excites me. The after-sales support. Now that&rsquo;s
some vendor lock-in. We outfit a military with Better Future Combat
Augmentations, they&rsquo;re going to need servicing. Training.
Upgrades! They&rsquo;ll live and die on our bug fixes. I mean that
literally. It&rsquo;s a never-ending revenue stream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I liked
<em>Better Future Bioreplacement Technology</em>,&rdquo; said Cassandra
Cautery. &ldquo;What happened to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marketing,&rdquo;
said the Manager. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t test as well. People are
uncomfortable with the concept of replacing. They prefer to add.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously
this is all long-term. We have a lot of hard yards to cover first,
Charlie. A lot of quality assurance to go through. In-house testing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to be a super-solder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery
smiled and tried to hide it. The Manager said, &ldquo;Of course you
don&rsquo;t. And I don&rsquo;t want you to be! You&rsquo;re a
thinker, Charlie. Your role is hands-off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So to
speak,&rdquo; I said. This was a quip. I had become a bit of a
quipper, since spending time with Lola. She would have appreciated
this one, I think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I
mean,&rdquo; said the Manager, &ldquo;is there&rsquo;s no need to put
yourself through the testing process. We have people for that. Test
subjects. We give them one Better Future Combat Augmentation each,
let them work through the kinks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was already
shaking my head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make parts for other
people. I just want to rebuild myself.&rdquo; Cassandra Cautery
inhaled, so I added: &ldquo;And I guess I know you need a product at
some stage. But right now, I&rsquo;m still experimenting. On me.
That&rsquo;s what this project is about. Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Manager
scratched his ear. &ldquo;Well, Charlie, that&rsquo;s not completely
realistic. These in-house tests, they&rsquo;re not something I&rsquo;m
proposing. They&rsquo;ve already begun.&rdquo;</p>
