<p>&ldquo;The
equipment carried by the average modern-day soldier weighs a hundred
fifty pounds.&rdquo; The Manager spread his palms. The light flooding
in the window behind him made this gesture vaguely Messianic. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
your standard grunt. You start talking specialists, some of them are
lugging half that again. We have equipment that could radically
increase their effectiveness, but they simply can&rsquo;t carry it.
War has become a load-bearing exercise. A logistics puzzle. And sure,
tell me it&rsquo;s never been any different. Tell me that throughout
history, battles have been won on the back of resource selection and
co-ordination. And I&rsquo;ll agree with you, Charlie, to a point.
But let me say this. An army of soldiers who run at fifty miles per
hour, leap twenty feet into the air, carry an inbuilt arsenal capable
of handling any contingency, and walk through enemy fire like it&rsquo;s
a summer rain&mdash;that army could do some damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie has
some interesting spine work in the pipeline,&rdquo; said Cassandra
Cautery. &ldquo;I should get you an updated report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll
tell you what really excites me. The after-sales support. Now that&rsquo;s
some serious vendor lock-in. We outfit a military with Better Future
Combat Augmentations, they&rsquo;re going to need servicing.
Training. Upgrades! They&rsquo;ll live and die on our bug fixes. I
mean that literally. It&rsquo;s a never-ending revenue stream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I liked
<em>Bioreplacement Technology</em>,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery.
&ldquo;What happened to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marketing,&rdquo;
said the Manager. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t test as well. People are
uncomfortable with the idea of replacing. They prefer to add.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously
this is all off in the distance. We have a lot of hard yards to cover
first, Charlie. A lot of quality assurance. A lot of in-house
testing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to be a super-solder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery
smiled and tried to hide it. The Manager said, &ldquo;Of course you
don&rsquo;t! And I don&rsquo;t want you to be. You&rsquo;re a
thinker, Charlie. Your role is hands-off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So to
speak,&rdquo; I said. This was a quip. I had become a bit of a
quipper, since spending time with Lola. She would have appreciated
this one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, what I
mean,&rdquo; said the Manager, &ldquo;is there&rsquo;s no need for
you to put yourself through the testing process. We have people for
that. Volunteers, eager to count themselves amongst the first
recipients of a Better Future Combat Augmentation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was already
shaking my head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make parts for other
people. I&rsquo;m building parts for me. If you want products, well,
I guess once I&rsquo;m further advanced in my project, and know from
my own testing what works, I could look at military applications. But
that&rsquo;s a long way off. Maybe years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Manager
scratched his ear. &ldquo;Well, you misunderstand me a little. These
in-house test subjects, they&rsquo;re not something I&rsquo;m
proposing. We&rsquo;ve already begun.&rdquo;</p>
