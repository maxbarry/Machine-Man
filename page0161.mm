<p>I followed a Better
Future van up the ramp. It moved slowly, as if afraid of leaving me
behind, and I felt insulted. Didn&rsquo;t they know what I was? <em>Kick
it</em>, said the Contours, or a sentiment to that effect, and I
didn&rsquo;t, but I sympathized with their frustration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Neumann?
This is Jason. Can you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked down. I
had a speaker near my liver. Actually, I had a speaker where I used
to have a liver. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re
almost at the top. Are you ready for some acceleration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The van sprang
ahead. I didn&rsquo;t need to instruct the Contours: they shifted
into a lope all by themselves. It was a world away from the first
time I&rsquo;d ridden out on artificial legs, when I had felt as if
they were trying to shake every bone in my body out through the top
of my head; improvements to the model, I guessed, plus the fact that
I had fewer bones. It was a relief to no longer feel as if I was
risking serious neck damage with each step. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other
cars will pull alongside you. They&rsquo;ll form a cordon to try to
cover you from emergency services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rectangle of
light rushed toward me. As the ramp broadened, a Hummer roared up on
each side. Then we were outside, and fresh air slapped me in the
face. We turned onto the road and I got a little too close to the
Hummer on the left; my gun-arm brushed against it, its tires
squealed.</p>
<p><em>That was deliberate</em>,
I said. <em>Wasn&rsquo;t it?</em>
Because I had written some of this software: collision avoidance was
not that hard. My parts were silent. But I could feel their
satisfaction. <em>Okay</em>, I
said. <em>Okay, then</em>.</p>
<p>I veered left. My
gun-arm touched the side of the Hummer. I pushed, gentle but firm. It
tried to resist; white smoke streamed from its tires. My
Jason-speaker barked unintelligibly. I pushed the Hummer again,
harder, until it popped out of formation and spun in a smoking
half-circle. Then I accelerated through the gap and was running, wind
blasting past me, and that feeling, it was pure joy.</p>
