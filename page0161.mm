<p>I followed a Better
Future van up the ramp. It moved slowly, as if afraid of leaving me
behind, and I felt insulted. Didn&rsquo;t they know what I was? <em>Kick
it</em>, said the Contours, or a sentiment to that effect, and I
smiled, because I understood their frustration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Neumann?
This is Jason. Can you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked down. I
had a speaker near my liver. Actually, I had a speaker where I used
to have a liver. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re
almost at the top. Are you ready for some acceleration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The van sprang
ahead. I didn&rsquo;t need to instruct the Contours: they shifted
into an easy lope all by themselves. It was far smoother to the first
time I&rsquo;d ridden out on artificial legs, which had felt as if
they were trying to shake every bone in my body out through the top
of my head; maybe because of some improvements to gait and balance,
or maybe because I had fewer bones. I no longer felt as if I was
risking serious neck damage with each step. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other
cars are going to pull alongside you,&rdquo; said the speaker. &ldquo;The
idea here is they&rsquo;ll form a cordon, to cover you from emergency
services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rectangle of
light rushed toward me. As the ramp broadened, a Hummer moved up on
each side. Then suddenly we were outside. Fresh air slapped me in the
face. Red and blue light flashed around me, but I could see little
beyond the cars surrounding me, which of course was the general idea.
We turned onto the road. I got a little too close to the Hummer on
the left; my gun-arm brushed against it and its tires squealed.</p>
<p><em>That was deliberate</em>,
I said. <em>Wasn&rsquo;t it?</em>
Because I had written some of this software: collision avoidance was
not that hard. My parts were silent, but I could feel their
satisfaction. <em>Okay</em>, I
said. <em>Okay, then</em>.</p>
<p>I
veered left. My arm touched the side of the Hummer and I pushed. It
tried to resist; white smoke streamed from its tires. My
Jason-speaker barked unintelligably. I nudged the Hummer again and it
hopped and spun in a half-circle. I accelerated through the gap it
left, and then I was running, wind blasting past me, and the feeling,
it was like pure joy.</p>
