<p>I followed a Better
Future van up the ramp. It moved slowly, as if afraid of leaving me
behind, so must have been driven by someone who had no idea what I
was. More vehicles followed behind. This was their plan to protect me
from observation: surround me with cars. I was okay with that. I just
wished they would drive faster. The Contour Threes were essentially
ambulating, one hoof remaining in contact with the ground all times,
and I felt bad for them, like they were being insulted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Neumann?
This is Jason. Can you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced down. I
had a speaker near my liver, apparently. Actually, I had a speaker
where I used to have a liver. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re
almost at the top. Are you ready for some acceleration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;Yes yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The van ahead
sprung forward. I didn&rsquo;t need to say anything to the Contours:
they accelerated by themselves, quickly catching up. Behind me, I
heard the Hummers&rsquo; engines roaring. A rectangle of light rushed
toward me, and then we were outside. The cars behind moved up to
flank me, and 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The air sang. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>That was the plan
to protect me from observation: surround me with cars. 
</p>
<p>There were two on
the ramp ahead of me</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>ran up the ramp
behind a Better Future van. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This was the plan
to protect me from observation with a cordon of Better Future vans
and Hummers. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>moving in perfect
balance, and the feeling, it was like pure joy.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I moved. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like
the old woman who swallowed a fly. You know that one? <em>She
swallowed a spider to catch the fly... she swallowed a bird to catch
the spider</em>...&rdquo; 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Car escort
out of the parking lot: he runs. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Then we reached the
lobby, although it was a moment before I realized this, because last
time I had been here the walls were not scorched black and spattered
with bullet holes, and there was glass in the front, and it did not
reek of smoke.</p>

<p>TUE: Running. I was
a Lola-Rescuing machine. He gets happy. He gets in tune. A
Carl-killing machine. The quips come back.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>I am a Lola-rescuing machine</em>,
I thought, and my parts said: <em>I am a Lola-rescuing machine</em>.
I smiled, because if that wasn&rsquo;t an echo, it was quite clever. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well. Good
luck. Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to
pee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s...
I don&rsquo;t know what that is,&rdquo; said Jason. &ldquo;But you
can&rsquo;t pee, so it should be safe to go ahead and feel like
you&rsquo;re doing that.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
