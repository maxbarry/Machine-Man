<p>When I was fifteen, I was almost killed
by a shirtless man in an Audi X3. He came around the corner of the
suburban street I was crossing en route to school and accelerated
toward me. I think he expected me to scurry out of the way. But I
didn&rsquo;t, because I was fifteen, and it was more important to me
to appear tough to strangers than live. I think the shirtless man
shared this philosophy, because his car jagged toward me. Its engine
pitch rose into a scream. I was sure I was doing to die. If the
vehicle had been anything less than a triumph of modern engineering,
I would have. But at the last possible second&mdash;a second too
late, in a different car&mdash;the Audi came to a smoking halt on the
wrong side of the road.</p>
<p>He leaned out the window and screamed
abuse. This was when I saw he was shirtless. He wore mirror shades
and chunky jewellery and nothing else, as far as I could see. As he
stabbed fingers in my direction, to emphasize points I couldn&rsquo;t
hear over his sound system, a watch that must have weighed five
pounds flew around, dazzling when it caught the sunlight.</p>
<p>Eventually the shirtless man finished
shouting and the Audi took off. I watched it slingshot around the
next corner. If anyone had been coming, he would have killed them.</p>
<p>I hefted my bag. As I walked to school,
it occurred to me that we had reached an important milestone, as a
society. We had begun making better machines than people.</p>
