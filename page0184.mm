<p>Light. A strange
kind of light. Diffuse. I couldn&rsquo;t focus. I felt disorientated
and stupid. I had forgotten where I was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holding...
that&rsquo;s good. Keep that there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little
interplay on the third core. Nothing serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay... let
him have a look. But slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light lifted. Or rather, the thing
that had been draped over me was lifted, by a man in a striped shirt
and bow tie. The thing was a lab coat. As it pulled back, the sleeve
snagged and pulled me around in a half-circle until I was facing the
steel gray box, the monitor. I tried to scream. Words streamed across
the screen: <span class="charlietext">NO
BOX BOX I AM IN A BOX NN N L N OLALOLALOLALOLALOLALOLA</span>&mdash;</p>
<p>The lab coat
flopped over me again, blocking my sight. &ldquo;Reverse that!
Reverse all that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking him
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit! You
see that output?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt myself
shrinking, ceasing to exist in pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s
right. Maybe...&rdquo; Before I could hear the rest of this, I was
gone.</p>
