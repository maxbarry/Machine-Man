<p>Light. A strange
kind of light. Very diffuse. I couldn&rsquo;t see anything. It was
merely light.</p>
<p>I had forgotten:
where was I again?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holding...
that&rsquo;s good. Keep that there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up on all

pulled back, the sleeve snagged and pulled me around in a half-circle
until I was facing the gray box, the monitor. I tried to scream, and
words spilled across the screen: BOX I AM A DEAD MACHINE BOX NO NO
BACK ACK OLALOLALOLALOLALOLALOLALOLA.</p>
<p>The man threw the
lab coat over me again. &ldquo;Reverse that! Reverse all that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking him
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see that
output?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe she
was right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt myself
shrinking, ceasing to exist in pieces. I was winking out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
give her a try,&rdquo; said the voice.</p>
