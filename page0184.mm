<p>The
woman&rsquo;s eyes rose. Her pupils moved when she did that, I
noticed. She did not focus on a single object. She was tracking
something. And in the reflection of her eyeballs, I could see a hint
of what: dancing squiggles on a flat, bright rectangle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
show you,&rdquo; she said. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Many argued
advocated giving up, since there was, frankly, so little of you left
to save. They thought it would be a kindness to let you go. But
others argued vociferously against this.&rdquo; Her eyes twinkled.
&ldquo;One in particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to say:
<em>Lola?</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not sure if...&rdquo; She looked around. &ldquo;If we really want
to...&rdquo; Whatever she saw there, she nodded and turned back to
me. &ldquo;Dr. Neumann, what I&rsquo;m about to say will come as a
shock. There&rsquo;s really no way for me to break this to you
gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the
months, various parts of your living body became unsupportable. You
must remember that you essentially had no major organs. Without a
liver, your immune system ... Your . Several times the medical team
had to abandon part of your body in order to preserve the brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be honest with you, Dr. Neumann. At this point you essentially became
a research project. You no longer had hope of a meaningful recovery,
of gaining any quality of life.

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a whistleblower. Better Future is... well,
it doesn&rsquo;t exist any more. Parts were absorbed into the
military, others were shut down. A few were sold off.&rdquo; He
shrugged. &ldquo;This happened years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> &lt;&lt; things he
can see &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; You&rsquo;d
think there would be people there. Especially Lola. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;
A face loomed over me. It was D. Peters, my old boss. I hadn&rsquo;t
seen that guy in a while. &ldquo;Hello, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I swallowed, or
tried to, but that wasn&rsquo;t happening either. I tried to say:
<em>What?</em></p>
<p>D Peters looked at
something to my left. His eyes flicked back and forth. He was a
little close for comfort, to be honest. I didn&rsquo;t see why he
needed to be in my personal space. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re recovering
from a serious trauma, Charlie. Don&rsquo;t expect everything to work
fine right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Good. That&rsquo;s
good, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a whistleblower. Better Future is... well,
it doesn&rsquo;t exist any more. Parts were absorbed into the
military, others were shut down. A few were sold off.&rdquo; He
shrugged. &ldquo;This happened years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Angelica?
D. Peters? Others? &gt;&gt; 
</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; So he&rsquo;s
worried he&rsquo;s in BF. &gt;&gt;</p>
