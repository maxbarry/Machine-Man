<p>Light. A strange
kind of light. Diffuse. I couldn&rsquo;t focus. I felt disorientated,
stupid. Where was I again?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holding...
that&rsquo;s good. Keep that there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up on all
three now. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. But
slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light lifted. Or rather, the thing
that had been draped over me was lifted, by a man in a striped shirt
and bow tie. The thing was a lab coat. As it pulled back, the sleeve
snagged and pulled me around in a half-circle until I was facing the
steel gray box, the monitor. I tried to scream. Words streamed across
the monitor: <span class="charlietext">GOD
NO BOX BOX I AM IN A BOX NN N L N OLALOLALOLALOLALOLALOLA&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The lab coat
flopped over me again, blocking my sight. &ldquo;Reverse that!
Reverse all that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking him
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see that
output?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt myself
shrinking. I was ceasing to exist in pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s
right,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;Maybe we&mdash;&rdquo; But
before I could hear the rest of this, I was gone.</p>
