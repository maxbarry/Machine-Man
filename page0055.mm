<p>Once Lola had fallen asleep, I wheeled
myself out into the corridor. Cassandra Cautery emerged from a door
ten feet away. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That was some
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always curious about
what motivates people to choose their careers,&rdquo; Cassandra

haven&rsquo;t disposed of it. So if it has sentimental value... well,
she can have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence fell.</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;I want to continue the
project.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
thought you might.&rdquo;</p>
