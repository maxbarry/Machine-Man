<p>When Lola had fallen asleep, I wheeled
myself out into the corridor. Cassandra Cautery emerged from a door
ten feet away. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That was some
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always curious about

haven&rsquo;t disposed of it. If... well, if it has sentimental
value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence fell. I said, &ldquo;I want to
continue the project.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Cassandra Cautery
said. &ldquo;I thought you might.&rdquo;</p>
