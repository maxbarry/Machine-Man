NOTES.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I once did one of
those personality tests.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; OK: The
Manager says they&rsquo;re interested in making super soldiers. He
says Lola&rsquo;s got an EMP in her chest. Explains how it works. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;
I want to end here with Charlie busting the fuck out, don&rsquo;t I?
I think so. I think Charlie says he&rsquo;s got to get back to Lola,
and the Manager says Lola is taken care of. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;
I think the Manager should make it very clear to Charlie that there&rsquo;s
only one way out here. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;
Charlie leaps out through the drapes. They protect him from shattered
glass. Then he grabs Lola and they run off. I think he cleans out the
Repo of parts, too. Maybe some guards shoot at him. It&rsquo;s a cool
action scene. Come up with some unusual things. And remember Charlie
is not tough. He&rsquo;s a smart guy afraid for his life with some
kick ass legs. &gt;&gt;</p>
