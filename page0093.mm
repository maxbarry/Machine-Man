<p>My legs slowed.
They and I came to a halt not far from a small, elderly woman who was
struggling up some steps with bags of groceries. She came to a halt,
too, when she saw my hooves. Her eyes bulged. &ldquo;<em>Diablo.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had to go back.
Lola Banks was still in there. Probably in her suite, waiting for me
to return with the scanner. Her fingers maybe touching her chest,
then pulling away; trying not to wonder what it was the company had
installed in her chest. Trying to concentrate on what she knew: that
I was coming back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Diablo!</em>&rdquo;
shrieked the woman. &ldquo;<em>Diablo!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other hand,
Better Future had guards. Guards with guns. Guns they weren&rsquo;t
shy about using. What was I, an idiot? I couldn&rsquo;t run back in
there. They would kill me.</p>
<p>I imagined
Cassandra Cautery knocking on Lola&rsquo;s door. Smiling as Lola
opened it. <em>Charlie sent me to fetch you. He wants you to come down
to the lab</em>. Because Cautery would have to assume it was over.
That I would bring the government down on them. And that all evidence
of wrongdoing had to be eradicated before then. I saw Cautery place a
hand in the small of Lola&rsquo;s back, and steer her toward the
elevators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Diablo!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet,&rdquo;
I said, because that was making it really hard to think. Maybe there
was a back way in. An entrance not protected by blast doors and
security guards on high alert. I racked my brains. No. There was not.</p>
<p>But Lola. But Lola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Diabloooo!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why am
I going back?&rdquo; I yelled. The Contours began to hammer the
sidewalk, bearing me to Better Future.</p>
