the fact is, that doesn&rsquo;t matter very much, Charlie. That only
means we flip your off switch and put you in the van ourselves.&rdquo;
She gestured, and something in the darkness whined. I could guess
that one: a power loader. &ldquo;And you know what? Screw you. There.
I said it. I held your hand through this entire goddamn process, and
when I ask you for one thing...&rdquo; She shook her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
fine. It&rsquo;s fine. We don&rsquo;t need you any more, anyway.</p>
