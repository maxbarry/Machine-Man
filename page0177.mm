<p>Cassandra Cautery
hesitated. &ldquo;You mean, okay, as in, &lsquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll get
in the van?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head. I
didn&rsquo;t look at her: I was watching Lola smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
Cassandra Cautery put her hands on her hips and looked at the ground.
&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; This one was softer. I felt a little guilty,
because Cassandra Cautery was probably not a bad person. She was
probably just trying to do her best in a difficult situation. I
opened my mouth to say this. &ldquo;Well, the fact is, that doesn&rsquo;t
matter very much, Charlie. That only means we flip your off switch
and put you in the goddamn van ourselves.&rdquo; She gestured. In the
darkness, something whined. I could guess that one: a power loader.
&ldquo;And you know what? Screw you. There. I said it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More figures
emerged from the gloom, among them Jason, my lab assistant. He looked
vaguely embarrassed and carried in one hand a small black device the
size of a cellphone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
deserve those parts,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
been a whiny pain in the ass from day one and I can&rsquo;t wait to
give them to someone more manageable.&rdquo; Her eyes moved to Lola.
&ldquo;That goes for you, too.&rdquo; She turned to Jason. &ldquo;Turn
him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo;
said Jason. I was kind of hoping Jason might be about to reveal a
previously unsuspected affection for me, but from the way his eyes
slid away from mine, I realized this was not going to happen. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;Wait a minute. I didn&rsquo;t think this through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
turn him off!&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could grab Lola
and run. I would make it two steps before my body turned to stone. I
would be brain-dead within three minutes. It was not a great option.
I could take one step and club Cassandra Cautery into the van. More
appealing. But with the same end result: me inert, dying. That left
Jason, ten steps away. I was fast. I could close that distance in two
seconds, swat the device out of his hand. It was probably a temporary
solution, in that this black thing was unlikely to be the only method
they had of shutting me down. But it was something.</p>
<p>Jason&rsquo;s thumb
slid over the device. I realized he was watching me, wearing the same
expression he&rsquo;d had on the day I sat waiting for him in the
lab, my one leg dangling over the edge of the Clamp. He&rsquo;d
lunged for the Big Red Button and been too late. He would not let me
beat him today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick
quick,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;No time to lose.&rdquo;</p>
