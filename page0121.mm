<p>I came to see the
dogs as a hive mind. When I made my way to the bathroom&mdash;wobbling
along on a skateboard I had found under the bed, pushing myself with
my one functional hand&mdash;I would first encounter just one dog. It
would be sitting on the floorboards, scratching an ear, chewing its
jacket, or something equally pointless. It would get to its feet and
stare at me, its tiny brain visibly struggling to figure out this
wheeled man. Then it would panic and scamper away.</p>
<p>But when I emerged
from the bathroom, sweating from wrestling the toilet into
submission, I would find three of them waiting at the top of the
corridor. &ldquo;Shoo,&rdquo; I would say, or pretend like I was
going to lunge at them. But they wouldn&rsquo;t move. They would just
sit there, side-by-side, in their little outfits, communicating
telepathically. There was no fear in their glittering eyes, only
plots. The hive mind they comprised, Dog, it was planning something.
Dog was figuring out how to turn my situation to its advantage. As I
rolled toward my bedroom, Dog&rsquo;s many eyes would burn into my
back. I couldn&rsquo;t shut that door fast enough.</p>
