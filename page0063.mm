<p>Cassandra Cautery was not pleased to
hear about my phantom pain. I hadn&rsquo;t meant to tell her. I was
sitting in her office, talking about how the surgeons should remove
my arm, and her eyes drifted down to my left calf. I realized I was
absent-mindedly kneading the titanium there, as if it were a sore
muscle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything all right?&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a glitch.&rdquo; I forced
myself to put my hand in my lap. &ldquo;Nothing significant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery rose from her office
chair and walked around the desk. She stopped on the rug, rested her
butt against the desk, and folded her arms. I didn&rsquo;t like the
look of this. &ldquo;Charlie, imagine we&rsquo;re building a body.&rdquo;
I opened my mouth to say I <em>was</em>
building a body, but she held up one finger. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a
wonderful body, one we&rsquo;re very interested in getting right.
Let&rsquo;s also say that all the ideas for how to build this body,
they come from one particular brain. That brain is very important,
wouldn&rsquo;t you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded. &ldquo;In
fact, it&rsquo;s crucial. If we are building this body, the one thing
we must do, the absolute top priority, is keep the brain safe. Do you
agree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to me,
Charlie, the body is not those pieces you&rsquo;re wearing. It&rsquo;s
not the prosthetics themselves. It&rsquo;s the capacity to produce
them. The body I&rsquo;m building, Charlie, is a corporate entity
with the ability to create artificial parts. Do you see the
difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you
do. And you&rsquo;re the brain, Charlie. You&rsquo;re the thing I
must protect. So when I hear about these...&rdquo; She gestured at my
legs. &ldquo;These unexpected technical problems&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glitch,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;One glitch. Which is temporary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When
I hear about that, do you know what I feel like doing? I feel like
plucking that brain right out of the body and putting it in a jar.
Somewhere safe, so that no matter what happens to the body, what
mistakes are made, what <em>glitches</em>
we may encounter, the brain is safe. You can understand that, can&rsquo;t
you? The need to separate the brain from the
body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But
<em>I&rsquo;m</em> the body,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m both. They can&rsquo;t be separated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine they
could,&rdquo; she said, and that was when I realized I hadn&rsquo;t
seen Carl for a while.</p>
