<p>Cassandra Cautery was not pleased to
hear about my phantom pain. I hadn&rsquo;t even meant to bring it up.
I had been sitting in her office, talking about operation procedure,
and noticed her eyes drifting down to my calves. I followed them and
realized I was rubbing the titanium, kneading it like a muscle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything all right?&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to get carried
away, but in the back of my mind, a lot of ideas were percolating
around Lola. Like how she had lost the heart her father gave her, and
maybe, one day, if things went right, I could give her one of mine.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery stopped me in the
corridor. &ldquo;Did you crush a wheelchair?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Give her a heart. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>But Lola had opened up to me; she had .
I had seen her heart. That was pretty good.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; He maybe goes back to the lab.
Eager to see if his equipment is there. But it would be good to set
up a dynamic with Lola, too. Maybe leave the lab for next week. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Charlie back in the lab. CC. 
She&rsquo;s not willing to risk Charlie sever more parts of himself.
He says, what&rsquo;s the point of making artificial limbs if I can&rsquo;t
attach them anywhere? &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>And then I realized I hadn&rsquo;t seen
Carl in a while.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>But I finally finished and sent a
mental command to extend the leg. It did. 
</p>
<p>It was not a smart move, rushing a
fitting like this. One bad connection and the Contours might launch
me into the ceiling. But 
</p>
<p>ead to me trying to flex an ankle and
launching myself into the ceiling. 
</p>
<p>inally I got the last essential
connection hooked up. 
</p>
<p>There was one thing I could do.</p>
<p>One theory with phantom pain was that
the brain still thinks</p>
<p>arises because the brain has lost its
ability 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You had to expect that would have
side-effects. 
</p>
<p>had only limited phantom sensations</p>
<p>This feeling strengthened when,
following my own limb 
</p>
<p>was what you got for allowing your
brain to 
</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think that people made
it up, exactly</p>
<p></p>
<p>This was not the first time this had
happened. I had felt odd sensations&mdash;itching and crawling, the
odd twinge&mdash;in body parts I no longer owned since the beginning.
But I had

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Contours lay on the floor; my
finger-glove 
</p>
<p>Then enough of my brain came online to
allow me to realize I didn&rsquo;t have any toes.</p>
<p>I found the lamp switch and pulled
myself into a sitting position. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>spent a few foggy moments groping
around in the sheets, trying to find my toes, before enough of my
brain came up to speed to realize why I couldn&rsquo;t find them.
