<p>The car leaped
forward. I aimed for a guard to the left of the Better Future van: an
older guy with a mustache. It was nothing personal. I mean, true, I&rsquo;m
not a fan of mustaches. But that wasn&rsquo;t why I aimed the car at
him. He just happened to be in front of the van, and I was keen to
avoid the rear in case Carl was about to leap out of there.</p>
<p>The guard shot at
us. Multiple guards shot at us, actually. I believe they were aiming
for the tires, not our bodies, but this wasn&rsquo;t clear at the
time and it was absolutely terrifying. A low, keening noise came out
of Lola. It sounded like we were being attacked by a gang of thugs
wielding baseball bats. Which would have been an improvement on
reality, now I think about it, and maybe I should have tried to
pretend that was happening, to calm her down. But I was busy
concentrating on crushing a series of rose bushes while not getting
killed.</p>
<p>The car bumped onto
the road. I hauled on the steering wheel, which is not easy to do
with one hand, from the passenger seat. &ldquo;Less acceleration!&rdquo;
I said, but not quickly enough, and we sideswiped a parked sedan.
&ldquo;More!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eeee,&rdquo;
said Lola. Her face was pale and sweaty. She had looked a lot like
this right before murdering my legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open your
eyes. We&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes popped
open. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh, thank God.&rdquo; Her
eyes flicked to the rear view mirror. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A four-way
intersection loomed ahead. &ldquo;I think you should open your eyes
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Trees flashed by.
Ahead was an intersection, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure 
</p>
<p></p>
<p> four-way
intersection, followed by another, and realized that job-sharing
driving duties was going to quickly become difficult. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I threw a glance
out of the rear window in time to see the Better Future van peel onto
the road behind us.
