<p></p>
<p>So we have
something of a puzzle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It sounds like... a
logic puzzle,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;Like a fox 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I
should just keep my eyes closed for a second.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>As each guard
popped out of the van, he drew a gun. Three, four now. Fanning out.
&ldquo;Because we don&rsquo;t want me to kill the car. That&rsquo;s
right, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;
Five guards. &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll
just take a moment...&rdquo; Exhale. &ldquo;And then we&rsquo;ll
drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I decided I didn&rsquo;t
want Lola seeing five guards pointing guns at her. &ldquo;You know
what? Just keep them closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep them
closed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;
I groped for a pole leg. &ldquo;And steer when I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She frowned. &ldquo;Steer
when... what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guards began to
close in. I angled the pole through Lola&rsquo;s legs until it
touched the accelerator. Then I pushed it down, hard. The car leaped
forward. &ldquo;<em>Left!</em>&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;<em>Steer left!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Not
totally sure I want them driving this way. You know, I figure Charlie
has to drive. He is the frickin hero.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to a happy place for a minute,&rdquo; she said. Her voice was
slow and measured. &ldquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please,
yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola closed her
eyes. She placed her palms on her lap and blew air through pursed
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you
doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
