<p>&ldquo;Carl wants
your parts,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. Behind her, the
streetscape grew industrial: we were getting closer to Better Future.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s set on the idea of taking away your
Bioreplacements, the same way you had us take away his arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
have any parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of
ours, no...&rdquo; She tapped her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
just wondering if that will matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I know
is Carl wants your parts, and his mental state is not very stable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think
he&rsquo;ll... what, pull my arms off? You think he wants to <em>kill</em>
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what&rsquo;s running through his head. Last time I saw him, he
was throwing people around the lobby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I threw a glance
out the rear window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t
worry.&rdquo; Cassandra Cautery patted my thigh. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s
going to be fine. I have a plan.&rdquo;</p>
