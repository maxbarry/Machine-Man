<p>&ldquo;Carl wants
to take your parts.&rdquo; She looked at my thighs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
have any parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of
ours, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just wondering if that will matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>What</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She crossed her
legs. &ldquo;Look, all I know is that Carl was quite set on
repossessing your legs, just like you had us take away his arms, and
that his psychological state is not very stable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think
he&rsquo;ll, what, pull my arms off? My actual arms? You think he
wants to <em>kill</em> me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what&rsquo;s running through his head,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Last
time I saw him, two

<p>he was throwing a

around like dolls.

<p>&lt;&lt; The whole
time, ever since I heard Angelica on the phone, louder since the
white Better Future and a drumbeat since Cautery: parts. &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>P135: &lt;&lt;
&ldquo;Carl came to us.&rdquo; No shrinks. Experts. Didn&rsquo;t
inquire further. He got angry. You might recall our problems.
Psychotic breaks. Carl&rsquo;s nuts, and we can&rsquo;t contain
him.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>P136+: Interim CEO.
Fresh starts. Shut down the program. No parts for soliders. But you,
Charlie, we need you to help stop him. Charlie shaking, his legs
crawling, thinking: Mmm, lab.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might
recall the Manager mentioned we were experiencing a few teething
problems with Bioreplacements,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;Well.
More specifically, our test subjects were. Do you recall the nature
of the problem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remembered the
Manager telling me they had implanted a device in Lola without her
knowledge. I remembered kicking him out a window. Everything else was
fuzzy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depression.
Stress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Psychotic
breaks.&rdquo; She adjusted her skirt. &ldquo;For reasons we haven&rsquo;t
adequately explored, not everyone adjusted to their Bioreplacement as
effortlessly as you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought
you were calling them Combat Augmentations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I changed
it. I never liked <em>Augmentation</em>. It sounded like something you
choose to match your purse.&rdquo; She frowned at her nails. &ldquo;But
these psychological issues, they&rsquo;ve been very troublesome. You
must understand how frustrating it is, having a million-odd dollars
worth of experimental hardware locked up inside someone who sits in
their room all day crying. Who won&rsquo;t do any of the prescribed
tests. Although at least that&rsquo;s better than...&rdquo; She shook
her head. &ldquo;The point is: we were wrong, Charlie. We were wrong
and you were right. We got ahead of ourselves, tried to do too much
too quickly. We thought what worked for you would work for everybody.
And it didn&rsquo;t. It doesn&rsquo;t. We don&rsquo;t know why. But
we&rsquo;ve learned our lesson. I&rsquo;m sitting here and telling
you: we should never have tried to expand this project to other
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having said
that, you did kill our CEO. So there&rsquo;s fault on both sides.&rdquo;
She glanced again out the rear window, and seemed satisifed with what
she saw. &ldquo;We presented that to the police as an accident, by
the way. There were those who wanted you drawn and quartered. But I
lobbied for you. What, I argued, do we gain from sending one of our
finest minds to prison? What do we stand to lose, if this becomes an
investigation? It was a good meeting. I don&rsquo;t mind saying,
Charlie, it was some of my best work. Did you know that the British
specifically appointed a wartime Prime Minister during the Second
World War? They did. Winston Churchill. He was one bloodthirsty
bastard. Firebombed Dresden. You wouldn&rsquo;t want him running your
country in peacetime. But a time of crisis demands a particular
skillset. It requires a leader prepared to achieve victory at any
cost. That&rsquo;s what I told the board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better
Future&rsquo;s Interim CEO. Right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;Well, congratulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be
honest, Charlie, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure they didn&rsquo;t simply
want someone to pin this on.&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;But thanks.&rdquo;</p>
