<p>&ldquo;Carl wants
your parts,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. Behind her, the
streetscape turned urban: we were entering the industrial district,
getting closer to Better Future. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s set on the idea of
taking away your Bioreplacements, like you had us take away his
arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
have any parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of
ours, no...&rdquo; She tapped her lips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just
wondering if that will matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, all I
know is that Carl wants your parts, and his psychological state is
not very stable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think
he&rsquo;ll, what, pull my arms off? My actual arms? You think he
wants to <em>kill</em> me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what&rsquo;s running through his head. Last time I saw him, he
was throwing our people around the lobby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I squirmed in my
seat, checking the windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t
worry.&rdquo; Cassandra Cautery patted my thigh. &ldquo;I have a
plan. Everything&rsquo;s going to be just fine.&rdquo;</p>
