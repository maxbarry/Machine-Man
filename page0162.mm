<p>I ran through
traffic, passing cars. This didn&rsquo;t sit very well with Better
Future&rsquo;s stated goal of keeping me out of sight, but I wasn&rsquo;t
sure how they thought I was supposed to do that. Also, it was their
goal, not mine. My goal was to rescue Lola and get her back to Better
Future before her heart stopped. I ran through a few possible
scenarios of how this confrontation with Carl might pan out, cars
honking and tires screeching around me, but I couldn&rsquo;t help
feel I was over-thinking it. The facts were, I had speed, strength,
smarts, and a gun. Carl had a couple of magic arms. What was he going
to do, punch me in the head? Actually, maybe yes. I should guard
against that. But that was about the extent of the danger he
represented. All I had to do was keep him at a distance.</p>
<p>A tingling ran down
my gun-arm. At first I thought this was my arm getting excited. Then
I heard the speaker, barely audible over the noise of me tearing up
bitumen. &ldquo;Dr. Neumann? Your armament is online.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they could
activate me remotely. That wasn&rsquo;t terrific news. It implied
they could deactivate me. But that was hard to focus on, because I
had an online gun-arm. That wasn&rsquo;t the kind of thing I could
let sit there. Once, early in my career at Better Future, I made the
mistake of purchasing a new cellphone the day before my project&rsquo;s
final results were due; I thought to ignore it for 24 hours, then
have a play as a reward for my hard work. Around three the next
morning, still discovering new features, I decided to call in sick.
This situation was like that, only attached to me, and with bullets.
<em>I should test it</em>, I thought. Because I couldn&rsquo;t wait to
discover how it worked with Carl running at me, swinging sledgehammer
arms. That would be really poor planning. I looked around.</p>
<p>Coming up on the
right was a giant billboard. On it, an attractive couple in bright
clothes laughed or danced or wrestled or something. Possibly they
were playing a Wii game. I thought: <em>That</em>.</p>
<p>Imagine a chainsaw.
An ear-splitting, bone-rattling chainsaw chewing up all before it.
That is about right.</p>
<p>Pieces of billboard
fell around me. As I ran through them, I thought: <em>I am a
Lola-rescuing machine</em>. And my parts said, <em>I am a Lola-rescuing
machine</em>, and I smiled, because if that wasn&rsquo;t an echo, it
was kind of clever.</p>
