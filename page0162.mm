<p>But I guess I got
the gist, because when he finished, I had a new thought, and this
was: <em>Carl doesn&rsquo;t sound that crazy.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Charlie
realizes Carl doesn&rsquo;t sound that insane. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Charlie
should vomit. Only it&rsquo;s not food. He should still feel weepy
about what he has become. He&rsquo;s separating from his parts. And
BF is trying to bundle him out the door as quickly as possible. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; BF brings
Charlie&rsquo;s gun online remotely? I think so. He can just break
the antenna. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop
moving,&rdquo; the doctor said. &ldquo;This is a fracture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So fix it.&rdquo;
She gestured. &ldquo;This guy is eighty percent artificial, you think
you can handle a bump on the head?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>The techs ran their
final tests, then Jason stood before me. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.
Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My arm is
cold.&rdquo; All eyes swung to it. I felt a little self-conscious,
because compared to the rest of me, that arm looked very weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His arm is
cold,&rdquo; echoed Jason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could...
um, obviously not a shirt, that wouldn&rsquo;t fit...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could
bandage it,&rdquo; suggested someone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that
restrict movement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some kind of
pancho? A hole for his head...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would
flap around. That doesn&rsquo;t cover his arm at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut the arm
off a jacket, attach a tether... no, wait...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it,&rdquo;
I said, because watching the brightest minds in Better Future stumped
by clothing was a little too much to bear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; I don&rsquo;t
think he can be naked... give the man some fucking clothes somehow.
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>take it on faith
that certain things would work 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Exactly how I would
avoid this was not clear to me at the time</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Eventually we
entered the underground parking lot. The main lights were off but
there were portable halogen lights, making everything blindingly
bright or inpenetrably dark. The air was filled with fumes from
idling Better Future vans and Hummers. I didn&rsquo;t know what that
was about.
