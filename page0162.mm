<p>I ran through
traffic, passing cars. This didn&rsquo;t sit very well with Better
Future&rsquo;s stated goal of keeping me out of sight, but I wasn&rsquo;t
sure how they thought I was supposed to do that. Also, it was their
goal, not mine. My goal was to rescue Lola and get her back to Better
Future before her heart stopped. As cars honked and tires screeched
around me, I ran through a few possible scenarios of how this
confrontation might pan out, but I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel I was
over-thinking it. The facts were, I had speed, strength, and a gun,
and Carl had a couple of arms. What was he going to do, punch me in
the head? Actually, maybe yes. I should guard against that. But that
was about the extent of the danger represented by Carl. And I wasn&rsquo;t
about to let him get anywhere near striking distance.</p>
<p>A tingling ran down
my gun-arm. &ldquo;Dr. Neumann?&rdquo; I could barely hear the
speaker against the roar of wind. &ldquo;Your armament is now
online.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They could activate
me remotely. That wasn&rsquo;t terrific news. It implied they could
similarly deactivate me. But I couldn&rsquo;t focus on that now: I
had an online gun-arm. That wasn&rsquo;t the kind of thing I could
let sit there. Once early in my career at Better Future, I made the
mistake of purchasing a new cellphone the day before my project&rsquo;s
final results were due, thinking I would ignore it for 24 hours, then
have a play as a reward for my hard work. Around three AM the next
morning I was still discovering new features and decided to call in
sick. This was like that, only attached to me, and with bullets. <em>I
should test it</em>, I thought. I couldn&rsquo;t wait to discover how
this thing worked until Carl was running at me, swinging his
sledgehammer arms. I looked around.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It was incredibly
loud. The closest sound I had heard to this was a chainsaw: a
continuous tearing</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p><em>I am a Lola-rescuing machine</em>,
I thought. My parts said: <em>I am a Lola-rescuing machine</em>.
I smiled, because if it wasn&rsquo;t an echo, that was clever.</p>
