<p>The next weeks flew by. I spent my days
in the lab and my nights sleeping in one of the private bunk rooms.
Sometimes it was the other way around. I lost track of daylight for a
while there. There wasn&rsquo;t much of it, in the labs or bunk
rooms. I learned to tell the time by the ebb and flow of lab
assistants, the way they were quieter and more focused in the
mornings, scattier and prone to risk-taking at nights. I had too many
of them to remember, now. Occasionally their faces blended together,
and I would refer to them by their function, like: &ldquo;Waveform
Damper, show that to Nerve Interfacer, please.&rdquo; But they didn&rsquo;t
seem to mind. They were very deferential.</p>
<p>In between, I visited Lola. They had
moved her to a live-in suite in an upper section of the building. It
was a managerial level, I think, although I never saw any managers. I
did see lots of potted plants. Those cheerful splashes of green made
me wistful, and I felt like installing some plants in the lab, to
brighten it up, although of course I couldn&rsquo;t, because of
contamination. But I did take one from beside the elevator and put it
in the corner of my bunk room. I could do things like that, now I was
important. The plant sat there a while and I kind of forgot about it
until one day, or maybe night, I saw it slumped over the side of its
pot, brown and limp. I hadn&rsquo;t watered it. Also, the lack of
natural light may have been a problem.</p>
<p>As I sat on my bunk and looked at that
plant, I felt annoyed. There was something pathetic about an organism
that couldn&rsquo;t even live if you left it alone a while. This was
maybe a little hard on the plant, which had after all been removed to
a hostile environment, but still, it reminded me why I was doing
this.</p>
