<p>The next weeks flew by. I spent my days
in the lab and my nights sleeping in one of the private bunk rooms.
Sometimes it was the other way around. I lost track of daylight for a
while there. There wasn&rsquo;t much of it, in the labs or bunk
rooms. I learned to tell the time by the ebb and flow of lab
assistants, the way they were quieter and more focused in the
mornings, scattier and prone to risk-taking at nights. I had twelve
of them now, too many to remember. They were very deferential. That
was nice.</p>
<p>In between, I visited Lola. They had
moved her to a live-in suite in an upper section of the building. It
was a managerial level, I think, although I never saw any managers. I
did see lots of potted plants. Those cheerful splashes of green made
me a little wistful, and I felt like installing some plants in the
lab, to brighten it up, although of course I couldn&rsquo;t, because
of contamination. But I decided to take one from beside the elevator
and put it in the corner of my bunk room. I could do things like
that, now I was important. The plant sat there for a while and I kind
of forgot about it until one day, or maybe night, I noticed it
slumped over the side of its pot, brown and limp. I hadn&rsquo;t
watered it. Also, the lack of natural light may have been a problem.</p>
<p>As I sat on my bunk and looked at that
plant, I felt annoyed. There was something pathetic about an organism
that couldn&rsquo;t even live if you left it alone a while. This was
maybe a little hard on the plant, which after all had been removed to
a hostile environment, but still, it reminded me why I was doing
this.</p>
