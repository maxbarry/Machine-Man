<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
someone said. &ldquo;Terrific. Look at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s...
what, two-stage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,
it&rsquo;s...&rdquo; Several people inhaled. Then there was clapping,
a whoop, and laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Online,&rdquo;
said the first voice. It made this word sound very heavy, the way you
might say: <em>We made it</em>. &ldquo;Online.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; I tried to
blink, but couldn&rsquo;t. I could see. I could see fine. Everything
was slightly off-color, over-saturated and painfully sharp. I could
tell I was in a room, though, a very bright room, with the ambiance
of an operating theater. It was not an operating theater. I had been
in enough of those to know. This was a lab.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A face appeared. It
was a friendly face, somewhat familiar. Perhaps a woman I had worked
with one time. From behind glasses, her eyes shone at me. &ldquo;Dr.
Neumann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I swallowed, or
tried to, but that wasn&rsquo;t happening either. I tried: <em>What..?</em></p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s
eyes flicked at something behind my head. She was a little close for
comfort, to be honest. She was all over my personal space. When her
eyes returned to me, they were so full of joy I thought she might
kiss me. Instead, she turned and addressed the people I couldn&rsquo;t
see. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a response. That&rsquo;s a clear response.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I
said: <em>Where am I?</em></p>
<p>Again, her eyes
moved to read something behind me. &ldquo;Dr. Neumann, you&rsquo;re
in a military research and development facility. We&rsquo;re about
sixty feet underground. A lot of people here have spent a lot of time
taking care of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to raise my
head to see these people. But apparently I was completely paralyzed.
I could feel my body. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what kind it was. But there
was something. I just couldn&rsquo;t move it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the
Better Future corporation was found to be engaging in a range of
human rights and corporate governance abuses, it was closed down and
its parts sold off. Some of those parts were acquired by private
firms, government departments, or joint ventures between the two. You
are in one of the latter.&rdquo; She glanced over her shoulder.
&ldquo;Should I..?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo;
someone said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the
paramedics found you, Dr. Neumann, you were already unconscious. They
couldn&rsquo;t move you; they could only keep you alive until a
larger medical team could arrive to separate you from your artificial
body. You might appreciate the challenge this involved, since you had
no human heart to compress, and little in the way of functional lungs
or other organs. You were considered extremely unlikely to survive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you did.
You nearly died a dozen times, but each time the medical team found a
way to keep your brain alive. Many argued advocated giving up, since
there was, frankly, so little of you left to save. They thought it
would be a kindness to let you go. But others argued vociferously
against this.&rdquo; Her eyes twinkled. &ldquo;One in particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to say:
<em>Lola?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not sure if...&rdquo; She looked around. &ldquo;If we really want
to...&rdquo; Whatever she saw there, she nodded and turned back to
me. &ldquo;Dr. Neumann, what I&rsquo;m about to say will come as a
shock. There&rsquo;s really no way for me to break this to you
gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the
months, various parts of your living body became unsupportable. You
must remember that you essentially had no major organs. Without a
liver, your immune system ... Your . Several times the medical team
had to abandon part of your body in order to preserve the brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be honest with you, Dr. Neumann. At this point you essentially became
a research project. You no longer had hope of a meaningful recovery,
of gaining any quality of life.

<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a whistleblower. Better Future is... well,
it doesn&rsquo;t exist any more. Parts were absorbed into the
military, others were shut down. A few were sold off.&rdquo; He
shrugged. &ldquo;This happened years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> &lt;&lt; things he
can see &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; You&rsquo;d
think there would be people there. Especially Lola. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;
A face loomed over me. It was D. Peters, my old boss. I hadn&rsquo;t
seen that guy in a while. &ldquo;Hello, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I swallowed, or
tried to, but that wasn&rsquo;t happening either. I tried to say:
<em>What?</em></p>
<p>D Peters looked at
something to my left. His eyes flicked back and forth. He was a
little close for comfort, to be honest. I didn&rsquo;t see why he
needed to be in my personal space. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re recovering
from a serious trauma, Charlie. Don&rsquo;t expect everything to work
fine right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Good. That&rsquo;s
good, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a whistleblower. Better Future is... well,
it doesn&rsquo;t exist any more. Parts were absorbed into the
military, others were shut down. A few were sold off.&rdquo; He
shrugged. &ldquo;This happened years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Angelica?
D. Peters? Others? &gt;&gt; 
</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; So he&rsquo;s
worried he&rsquo;s in BF. &gt;&gt;</p>
