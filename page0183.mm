<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
someone said. &ldquo;Terrific. Look at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s...
what is that, second-stage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,
it&rsquo;s...&rdquo; Several people inhaled. There was clapping, a
whoop, and laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Online,&rdquo;
said the first voice. The word sounded heavy, the way you might say:
<em>We made it</em>. &ldquo;Online.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to blink.
This didn&rsquo;t work. I could see, though. I could see a vase. The
vase was clear and contained three yellow flowers. Daffodils? Yes.
The vase sat on a plain white surface, behind which was a wall and a
painting. It seemed to me this white surface was probably a bedside
table, so I tried to turn my head to see the rest of the room. This
didn&rsquo;t work, either.</p>
<p>A face appeared
beside the vase. It was a friendly face, a woman&rsquo;s, possibly
Indian. Almond eyes shone at me from behind brown-rimmed glasses.
&ldquo;Dr. Neumann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I swallowed, or
tried to. I said: <em>What..?</em></p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s
eyes flicked at someone or something behind me. She was a little
close for comfort, this woman. I was glad to be awake and hopefully
safe but I wished she would back up a little out of my personal
space. When her eyes returned to mine, they were even more excited
than before. For a second I thought we were about to kiss. She turned
to the people I couldn&rsquo;t see. &ldquo;A response. A clear
response.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Where am I? </em>I
tried to say, but again, I made no sound. I felt panic, because when
no part of your body is doing what you tell it, not a single muscle,
that&rsquo;s worrisome. But it didn&rsquo;t seem to matter to the
woman: she nodded as if she understood anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re
in a research and development facility. We&rsquo;ve been taking care
of you. You came here as part of the asset diversification process
that occurred following the hearings and breakup of Better Future.
We&rsquo;re a private-public joint venture between a consortium of
private and government interests. You...&rdquo; She glanced behind
her. &ldquo;Should I..?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo;
someone said.</p>
<p>Her eyes settled on
me, steady and unblinking. &ldquo;When the paramedics found you,
you&rsquo;d already lost consciousness. They couldn&rsquo;t move you.
They could only keep you alive until a larger medical team arrived,
with specialized equipment. I wasn&rsquo;t there, but you can
appreciate their challenge, since you had no human heart they could
compress, and little in the way of functional major organs. But they
did it. They kept you alive. During the ensuring weeks, you came
close to death on many occasions. But each time, a way was found to
save you. This...&rdquo; She looked around. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure
we really want to...&rdquo; She nodded, turned back to me. &ldquo;Dr.
Neumann, this next part will come as a shock. There&rsquo;s no way to
break this to you gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The battle
to save you required sacrifices. Several times the medical team had
to abandon part of your body in order to save the remainder. And...
well, it eventually became clear you had no real chance of a
meaningful recovery. Of regaining any kind of quality of life. At
that point, it was decided that no further measures should be taken
to sustain you. But others... others did not share that view. A
compromise was reached. As part of that compromise, you came here.
And at that point, you essentially became a research project.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What
this means...&rdquo; She hesitated. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably best
if I show you.&rdquo; She reached out and turned my head with
one hand, her thumb and fingers a couple inches apart, with no sign
of exertion. The room span by. Then I was looking at a steel gray
box. At first I thought it was a piece of medical equipment. It had a
few tubes and wires, one of which snaked toward me. Alongside the box
sat a flatscreen monitor. I thought: <em>What is that?</em> and letters
spilled across the screen: <em>WHAT IS THAT</em>.</p>
<p>In the screen&rsquo;s
reflection, I saw daffodils. Beside them, sitting on the white
benchtop, was a tiny black cylinder mounted on a block of plastic.
The cylinder had a dark lens at the front and a wire coming out the
back. I realized I was looking at myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo;
someone said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s spiking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dampen that.
There&rsquo;s a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got a lot of runaway processes. Core is locking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut him
down. Shut him down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darkness, again.</p>
