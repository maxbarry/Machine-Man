<p>I tried to blink,
but couldn&rsquo;t. I could see. I could see fine. Everything was
slightly off-color, over-saturated and painfully sharp, but I could
tell I was in a bright room. It had the ambiance of an operating
theater. But it was not. I had been in enough operating theaters to
tell the difference. This was a lab. &lt;&lt; things he can see &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; You&rsquo;d
think there would be people there. Especially Lola. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;
A face loomed over me. It was D. Peters, my old boss. I hadn&rsquo;t
seen that guy in a while. &ldquo;Hello, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I swallowed, or
tried to, but that wasn&rsquo;t happening either. I tried to say:
<em>What?</em></p>
<p>D Peters looked at
something to my left. His eyes flicked back and forth. He was a
little close for comfort, to be honest. I didn&rsquo;t see why he
needed to be in my personal space. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re recovering
from a serious trauma, Charlie. Don&rsquo;t expect everything to work
fine right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Good. That&rsquo;s
good, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a whistleblower. Better Future is... well,
it doesn&rsquo;t exist any more. Parts were absorbed into the
military, others were shut down. A few were sold off.&rdquo; He
shrugged. &ldquo;This happened years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Angelica?
D. Peters? Others? &gt;&gt; 
</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; So he&rsquo;s
worried he&rsquo;s in BF. &gt;&gt;</p>
