<p>I tried to blink,
but couldn&rsquo;t. I could see, though. I could see fine. Everything
looked slightly off, like a TV show instead of real life, but I could
tell I was in a room. It was a bright room. It had the ambiance of an
operating theater. But it was not. I had been in enough operating
theaters to tell the difference. This was probably a laboratory. &lt;&lt;

<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo;
said D. Peters. &ldquo;Hello, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I swallowed, or
tried to, but that wasn&rsquo;t happening either. I tried to say:
<em>What?</em></p>
<p>D. Peters looked at
something to my left. His eyes flicked back and forth. He was a
little close for comfort, to be honest. He was in my personal space.
&ldquo;Good. That&rsquo;s good, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a whistleblower. Better Future is... well,
it doesn&rsquo;t exist any more. Parts were absorbed into the
military, others were shut down. A few were sold off.&rdquo; He
shrugged. &ldquo;This happened years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo;
said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;No need for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; I don&rsquo;t
think the parts can respond at all. They must be anti-Charlie at this
point. &gt;&gt;</p>
