<p>Cassandra Cautery
emerged from the darkness, picking her way across the rubble. She was
followed by three very cautious-looking Better Future security
guards, who were not armed, as far as I could tell. Others I couldn&rsquo;t
see hung back with the vehicle, shuffling and muttering.</p>
<p>Cassandra Catuery
stopped when she saw Carl. She did not seem particularly surprised,
or sad, or anything else. But she looked at him for a long time. Then
her eyes turned back to me, full of sympathy and understanding. &ldquo;Oh,
Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay away
from us,&rdquo; said Lola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a
lot of cops downstairs,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery, as if Lola
wasn&rsquo;t there. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sorry, Charlie, but we have
to get you out of here before they come up.&rdquo; She nodded to the
guards, who headed for Carl&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;Thanks to you, we
still have a chance to salvage this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I killed
Carl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded. &ldquo;And
it&rsquo;s a good thing, Charlie. I know it might not feel that way,
but it really is. Come back to work. We&rsquo;ll talk it through.&rdquo;
She glanced at the guards, who were now trying to figure out how to
pick up Carl. &ldquo;Get in the van and everything will be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at Lola.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to lose my parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course
you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;Who said you
did?&rdquo; I looked at her, because we both knew she had been
listening in, and she saw that I knew, and her face changed. &ldquo;Okay.
Look. I don&rsquo;t want to talk trash about your girlfriend,
Charlie, because she&rsquo;s been through a lot, we all have, but
what she suggested to you a minute ago, that&rsquo;s monstrous.
That&rsquo;s the most horrible thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard. And I&rsquo;ve,
well...&rdquo; A noise came out of her: not quite a laugh, but not
anything else, either. &ldquo;My honest opinion, if anyone here is
suffering from psychological issues, it&rsquo;s her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re
a twisted person,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just
calm down,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re enough
trouble without working yourself up. Charlie, I don&rsquo;t want to
put pressure on you, but we have to go. Now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My eyes met Lola&rsquo;s.
I thought: <em>Can I trust you?</em> And a part of me said <em>yes</em>,
and a part said <em>no</em>, and in the end it came down to which part
I liked better. I liked the part that trusted. I decided I wanted to
be that. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I said.</p>
