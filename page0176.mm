<p>Cassandra Cautery
emerged from the darkness, picking her way across the rubble. She was
followed by three very cautious-looking Better Future security
guards, who were not armed, as far as I could tell. Others hung back
with the vehicle, shuffling and murmuring, clanking things I couldn&rsquo;t
see.</p>
<p>Cassandra Catuery
stopped when she saw Carl. She did not seem particularly surprised,
or sad, or anything else. But she looked at him for a long time. Then
her eyes turned back to me, full of sympathy and understanding. &ldquo;Oh,
Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay away
from us,&rdquo; said Lola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are
cops downstairs,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery, as if Lola wasn&rsquo;t
there. &ldquo;A lot of them. And I&rsquo;m sorry, Charlie, but we
have to get you out of here before they come up.&rdquo; She nodded to
the guards, who headed for Carl&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;Thanks to you,
we still have a chance to salvage this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I killed
Carl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded. &ldquo;And
it&rsquo;s a good thing, Charlie. It might not feel that way, but it
really is. Come back to work, and I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo; She
glanced at the guards, who were now trying to figure out how to pick
up Carl. &ldquo;Get in the van and everything will be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to lose my parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course
you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;Who said you
did?&rdquo; I looked at her, because we both knew she had been
listening, and her face changed. &ldquo;Okay. Look. I don&rsquo;t
want to talk trash about your girlfriend, Charlie, because she&rsquo;s
been through a lot. Wee all have. But what she suggested to you a
minute ago, that&rsquo;s monstrous. That&rsquo;s the most horrible
thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard. And I&rsquo;ve, well...&rdquo; A noise
came out of her: not quite a laugh, but not anything else, either.
&ldquo;My honest opinion, Miss Banks has a few psychological issues
of her own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re
a twisted person,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just
calm down,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re enough
trouble without working yourself up. Charlie, I don&rsquo;t want to
put pressure on you, but we have to go. Now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My eyes met Lola&rsquo;s.
I thought: <em>Can I trust you?</em> A part of me said <em>yes</em> and a
part said <em>no</em> and in the end it came down to which part I liked
better. I didn&rsquo;t feel a closer affinity with one part. I didn&rsquo;t
try to figure out which felt more like me. I had come to suspect
there was no such thing as a core self: it was all malleable. I was
more alert when I drank coffee, happier when I was on drugs, and,
with a certain combination of missing limbs and free-roaming neurons,
I could kill people. It was pointless to ponder who I was, because
mostly I was neurochemicals. So instead I chose who I wanted to be
next. And I liked the part that trusted Lola. I decided I would be
that. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I said.</p>
