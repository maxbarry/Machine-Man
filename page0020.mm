<p>I woke, but not in the hospital. It
took me a while to figure this out, because I couldn&rsquo;t focus my
eyes, and because I really, really should have been in the hospital.
I had just crushed my right leg. There was nowhere else I belonged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... can&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
said someone. It sounded like my boss, D. Peters. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
just a coincidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in
coincidences.&rdquo; This was a woman, hard to place until her
alluring, toxic scent wafted across me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Check the security tape,&rdquo;
said D. Peters. &ldquo;He did it himself. There&rsquo;s no question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo; I tried to move my
head, to see Cassandra Cautery, but my muscles refused to respond. A
sun hung over my face, angry and brilliant. It looked familiar. It
was a lab light. The problem with this was it meant I was lying on
the lab floor, bleeding to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He moved,&rdquo; said D. Peters.
&ldquo;Just then. Did you see that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re panicking,&rdquo;
said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a panicker, Dick. It&rsquo;s
your panicking that led us here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cassandra, please&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a role for panickers at
this company,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not management.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo;
said D. Peters. Or Dick, I guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I should do to
you?&rdquo; I heard her shoes sliding across the floor. &ldquo;I
should... I should...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that thing,&rdquo;
said D. Peters.</p>
<p>I heard an intake of breath, then an
odd sound, like snuffling. I tried to raise my head, to see what this
was, but all my body managed was a sound like: &ldquo;<em>Guauah...</em>&rdquo;
</p>
<p>There was silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Cassandra
Cautery. &ldquo;Fine, then. Take him to the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rough hands seized me by my armpits. I
thought I recognized the hostile fingers of Carl the security guard.
The light above me swung away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And give him some of that
benzo-8,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;You know. The stuff
that wipes memory.&rdquo;</p>
