<p>I woke, but I was not in the hospital.
It took me a while to figure this out, because I couldn&rsquo;t focus
my eyes, and because I really, really should have been in the
hospital. I had just crushed my right leg. There was nowhere else I
belonged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... still don&rsquo;t think he
knows,&rdquo; said someone. It sounded like my boss, D. Peters. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
just a coincidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in
coincidences.&rdquo; This was a woman, hard to place until her scent
wafted across me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Check the security tape,&rdquo;
said D. Peters. &ldquo;He did it himself. There&rsquo;s no question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo; I tried to move my
head, to see Cassandra Cautery, but couldn&rsquo;t. A sun hung over
my face, angry and brilliant. It looked familiar. It was a lab light.
The problem with this was it suggested I was lying on the floor,
bleeding to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He moved,&rdquo; said D. Peters.
&ldquo;Just then. Did you see that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re panicking,&rdquo;
said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a panicker, Dennis. It&rsquo;s
your panicking that led us here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo;
said D. Peters. Or Dennis, I guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a role for panickers at
this company,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
not management.&rdquo;</p>
<p>D. Peters said nothing. After a while,
I said, &ldquo;Urgh...&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>There was silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Cassandra
Cautery. &ldquo;Fine, then. Take him to the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rough hands seized me by my armpits.
Was it Carl, the security guard who had carried me down here my first
day back at work? I thought I recognized his hostile fingers. The
light above me swung away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And give him some of that
benzo-8,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;You know. The stuff
that wipes memory.&rdquo;</p>
