<p>When I woke, I was not in the hospital.
It took me a while to figure this out, because I couldn&rsquo;t focus
my eyes, and because I really, really should have been in the
hospital. I had just crushed my right leg. There was no other place I
belonged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... for sure,&rdquo; said
someone. I think it was my boss, D. Peters. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a
hell of a coincidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in
coincidences.&rdquo; This was a woman, hard to place until her scent
wafted across me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Check the security tape,&rdquo;
said D. Peters. &ldquo;He did it himself. There&rsquo;s no question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; said Cassandra
Cautery. I tried to move my head, to see her, but couldn&rsquo;t. A
sun hung over my face, angry and brilliant white. It looked familiar.
It seemed to be a lab light. But I couldn&rsquo;t be in the lab. That
would make no sense. It would mean I was was bleeding to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He moved,&rdquo; said D. Peters.
&ldquo;Just then. Did you see that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re panicking,&rdquo;
said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a panicker, Dennis.
That&rsquo;s the reason we&rsquo;re in this situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; D.
Peters said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a role for panickers at
Better Future,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s
not management.&rdquo;</p>
<p>D. Peters said nothing. After a while,
I said, &ldquo;Urgh...&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>There was silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Cassandra
Cautery. &ldquo;Fine, then. Take him to the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hands seized me under the arms. Was it
Carl the security guard? I seemed to recognize his rough, hostile
grip. The blazing light above me swung away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And give him some of that
benzo-8,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;You know. The stuff
that wipes memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that was curious.</p>
