<h5>CHAPTER  SIX</h5>
<p>I woke from dreams of being crushed to the sound of a baby crying.
This wasn&rsquo;t unusual, because there was a intensive care
facility for newborns down the hall. I had glanced in one day, while
cruising the hallways in my new hospital-issue wheelchair, to see
rows of glowing pink- and brown- skinned babies, tiny limbs flailing
and clutching at the air inside yellow plastic incubators. Sometimes
couples filled the chairs outside, wrapped around each other. I
stopped going that way, though, when one man looked at me like: <em>Well,
that puts things into perspective</em>.</p>
<p>This baby sounded frightened. I heard another join it, then another.
Each crying baby seemed louder than the last, until I realized they
were just closer.</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery appeared in my doorway. She was wearing a snug gray
jacket over a pinstripe shirt with a big collar, and a little skirt.
It was a schoolgirl-meets-Wall-Street look. Her eyes glistened, as if
she was on the verge of tears. Her lips trembled as if she couldn&rsquo;t
keep the sympathy in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Charlie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You poor thing.&rdquo; I
could barely hear her, because of the screaming of the babies.</p>
