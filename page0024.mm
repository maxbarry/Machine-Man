<h5>CHAPTER  SIX</h5>
<p>I woke from dreams of being crushed to the sound of a baby wailing.
This wasn&rsquo;t unusual, because there was an intensive care
facility for newborns down the hall. Actually, the dream wasn&rsquo;t
unusual, either. Ever since I deliberately crushed my right leg, my
brain had been drowning me in dreams of being trapped in tiny,
shrinking spaces. I think it was fighting back. It was telling me
that it did not want to lose any more pieces. I found this annoying.
It was like the pain in my legs: a defensive mechanism deployed
against me by my own body. What my body needed to realize was that I
wasn&rsquo;t taking orders from organs. My biology existed in order
to serve me, not the other way around. These self-interested clumps
of flesh and fluid, they had better get with the program, because if
it came down to them or me, it was going to be me.</p>
