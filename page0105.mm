<p>We climbed the
steps to the neat, surburban house and stood on its darkened porch.
Lola raised her hand to ring the bell, then hesitated. &ldquo;One
thing, before we go in. Don&rsquo;t criticize Angelica&rsquo;s dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would I
criticize her dogs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not saying you would. Just don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You clearly
feel I would. Otherwise why mention it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there
something wrong with her dogs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;
said Lola. &ldquo;But she loves them, and if you say something, it
will be awkward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
mention the dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Do</em>
mention them. But only say nice things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pondered this. I
wasn&rsquo;t sure how you complimented a dog. &ldquo;Fine. I&rsquo;ll
say they are very attractive dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
say <em>that</em>. That sounds <em>creepy</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should
I say?&rdquo; I spread my arms, exasperated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
good at this. Tell me what to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say you like
their outfits,&rdquo; she said.</p>
