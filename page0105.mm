<p>We climbed the
steps to the neat, surburban house that apparently belonged to Lola&rsquo;s
doctor friend and stood on its darkened porch. Lola raised her hand
to ring the bell, then hesitated. &ldquo;One thing before we go in.
Don&rsquo;t criticize Angelica&rsquo;s dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would I
criticize her dogs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not saying you would. Just don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The logical
inconsistency here temporarily overwhelmed my pain and exhaustion.
Because I was that kind of guy. &ldquo;You must feel I would.
Otherwise why mention it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is something
wrong with her dogs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;
said Lola. &ldquo;But she loves them, and if you say something, it
will be awkward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;
Pain rising. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t mention the dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Do</em>
mention them. But only say nice things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.
She has very attractive dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
say that! That sounds creepy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should
I say? Lola. I&rsquo;m not good at this. Just tell me what to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated. &ldquo;Say
you like their outfits.&rdquo;</p>
