<p>I felt hungry. I
felt nauseus. I felt euphoric then furious and none of this had
anything to do with me. That was what I realized. At first I tried to
sort the real emotions from the chemically stimulated ones; then I
saw it didn&rsquo;t matter. Maybe I felt rage because Carl had taken
Lola, or maybe it was a side-effect of something I&rsquo;d been
injected with, or random feedback from the nerve interface&mdash;whatever
the source, what I was feeling was a neurochemical reaction. That was
what emotions were. And I no longer needed my body to tell me to rest
or eat or cool down: I had onboard systems for that. My emotions were
obsolete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hub online,&rdquo;
said Jason. &ldquo;Okay, Dr. Neumann, this is going to feel a little
weird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even the higher
emotions, like frustration and joy and desire, weren&rsquo;t they
just neurochemicals your body manufactured in order to encourage you
to do what it wanted? And I was not my body. I had never believed
that. So, in that sense, there were no real feelings. They were all
external and equally irrelevant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hub
allows us to maintain contact with you. There&rsquo;s a little camera
right here, in your chest, so we can see what&rsquo;s going on. This
little dot next to it, that&rsquo;s a microphone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t
matter how I felt. That was insignificant compared to what I did. I
wouldn&rsquo;t get Lola back by feeling. I would get her back by
applying my logical mind to extract maximum efficacy from the
resources at my disposal. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can also
use it to track Carl. I&rsquo;m going to activate that right now,
okay? You&rsquo;ll feel a distinct cold sensation, like a cool draft,
from his direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I had been
trying to talk to my parts. It wasn&rsquo;t easy, given all the
emotion crashing around. It was like trying to whisper in a
thunderstorm. I hadn&rsquo;t heard any response. But something had
been there in the original Contours. I thought something was probably
here, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, the
weapon. Well, you&rsquo;ve clearly figured out how to fire it. But,
for reference, the mental command is to clench your fist, hard. We&rsquo;ve
loaded it up, but we&rsquo;re not going to unlock it until you&rsquo;re
clear of the building, if that&rsquo;s okay. To, uh, be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An idea occurred to
me. Instead of calling to my parts one at a time, I imagined them as
a single entity. I thought: <em>Hello?</em></p>
<p>Something stirred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
Jason looked around. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re about done. Are you
ready to do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I
asked: <em>Are you?</em> My
parts said: <em>Yes</em>.</p>
