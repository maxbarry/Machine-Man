<p>I felt hungry. I
felt nauseus. I felt euphoric then furious and none of this had
anything to do with me. That was what I realized. At first I tried to
sort the real emotions from the chemically stimulated ones; then I
saw it didn&rsquo;t matter. Maybe I felt rage because Carl had stolen
Lola from me, or maybe it was a side-effect of something I&rsquo;d
been injected with, or random feedback from the nerve interface;
whatever the source, it was a simple neurochemical reaction. That was
what emotions were. And I didn&rsquo;t need my body to tell me to
rest or eat or cool down any more: I had onboard systems for that.
They were obsolete. Even the higher emotions, frustration and joy and
desire, those were feelings your body made to encourage you to do
things that would benefit it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hub online,&rdquo;
said Jason. &ldquo;Okay, Dr. Neumann, this is going to feel a little
weird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t
matter how I felt. That was insignificant compared to what I did. I
wouldn&rsquo;t get Lola back by feeling. I would get her back by
extracting maximum efficacy from the resources at my disposal. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hub
allows us to maintain contact with you. There&rsquo;s a little camera
right here, in your chest, so we can see what&rsquo;s going on. This
little dot next to it, that&rsquo;s a microphone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had been trying
to talk to my parts. It wasn&rsquo;t easy, given all the emotion
crashing around. It was like trying to whisper in a thunderstorm. I
had not heard any reply. But I felt something was there. It had been
in the original Contours. It should be back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can also
use it to track Carl. I&rsquo;m going to activate that right now,
okay? You&rsquo;ll feel a distinct cold sensation, like a cool draft,
from the direction he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An idea occurred to
me. Instead of trying to call out to them one at a time, I imagined
them as a single entity. I thought: <em>Hello?</em></p>
<p>Something stirred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weapon,
well, you&rsquo;ve clearly figured out how to fire that. But the
mental command is to clench your fist. We&rsquo;re not going to
unlock that until you&rsquo;re clear of the building. Just, uh, to be
safe.&rdquo; He took a breath, looked around. &ldquo;Well! Okay. I
think we&rsquo;re about done. Are you ready to do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I
said: <em>Are you?</em> My
parts said: <em>Yes</em>.</p>
