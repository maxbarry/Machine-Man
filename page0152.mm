<p>Then Cassandra
Cautery arrived. She sloshed into the operating theater with a
blood-stained towel pressed to her face and two orbiting assistants
who implored her to please sit down, let someone attend to that head.
I had never seen Cassandra Cautery mad before, or rather, I&rsquo;d
thought I had, but I hadn&rsquo;t. Her jaw muscles reminded me of
insects that had to bear food several times their own body weight
back to the nest.</p>
<p>I was trying to
stand still while men wrestled an arm onto me. It was an odd-looking
arm, not a model I&rsquo;d seen before, with a thin, tubular bicep
and a bulbous black forearm. From the way these guys were grunting
and sweating, hanging this thing off me would dislocate my
collarbone, so I was looking forward to discovering how this was
going to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What
happened?&rdquo; I asked Cassandra Cautery. I was becoming
increasingly focused. Every now and again, the woman with the syringe
jacked a device into a flip-up port on my groin, studied the readout,
and injected me with something new. I had a diagnostic crotch. I
wasn&rsquo;t sure how I felt about that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carl
happened.&rdquo; Cassandra Cautery leaned forward and spat something
into the water. I felt a little shocked, because things must be
serious, if Cassandra Cautery was doing that. &ldquo;He busted in and
kicked the snot out of us, that&rsquo;s what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was
looking for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God,&rdquo;
she said, staring at the cord dangling from my groin. &ldquo;Whose
idea was it to put that there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo;
said Jason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to
sell these things,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you put a <em>port</em>
in the <em>dick</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nerve
routing transport&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell you what you can do with the nerve routing transport.&rdquo; Her
chest hitched. Her one eye that wasn&rsquo;t covered by the towel
watered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God,&rdquo;
said Jason. Cassandra Cautery&rsquo;s assistants shuffled back.</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery&rsquo;s
eye fixed on me. &ldquo;I went to Yale.&rdquo; Her voice shook. &ldquo;Did
you know that? One time after class, my Advanced Antitrust lecturer
told me I was the student most likely to succeed, because while
others were stronger on theory, I had a <em>relentless desire to
organize</em>. Her words. She said she would <em>follow my career with
interest</em>.&rdquo; She squeezed closed her eye. A tear slipped down
her cheek. Her eye popped open. &ldquo;And <em>look at this shit!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room fell
silent but for the labored breathing of green-swathed men struggling
to fit me into an artificial arm. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
okay,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s... under control.&rdquo; She
looked at me again. &ldquo;Carl found you. We couldn&rsquo;t stop
him. He stood right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought
you said he wanted to kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said
Carl&rsquo;s <em>nuts</em>. I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s
thinking. Next time you see him, you ask him what the hell he&rsquo;s
doing. Check that. Next time you see him, just kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
<em>you</em> kill him,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the ones with
guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at the
prosthetic arm. The two men had aligned it with my shoulder. A third
was fooling around somewhere near my spine. Something locked into
place with a <em>thunk</em>. I became abruptly aware that my spine was
not bone. Cassandra Cautery said, &ldquo;Actually...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
