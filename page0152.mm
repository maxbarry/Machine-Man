<p>Then Cassandra
Cautery arrived. She sloshed into the operating theater with a
blood-stained towel pressed to her face and two orbiting assistants
who implored her to please sit down, let someone attend to that head.
I had never seen Cassandra Cautery mad before, or rather, I&rsquo;d
thought I had, but I hadn&rsquo;t. Her jaw muscles reminded me of
insects that had to bear food several times their own weight back to
the nest.</p>
<p>I was trying to
stand still while men wrestled an arm onto me. It was an odd-looking
arm, not a model I&rsquo;d seen before, with a thin, tubular bicep
and a bulbous black forearm. From the way these guys were grunting
and sweating, attaching this thing to me would dislocate my
collarbone, so I was looking forward to discovering how this was
going to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What
happened?&rdquo; I asked Cassandra Cautery. I was feeling focused
now. Every few minutes, the woman with the syringe jacked a device
into a flip-up port on my groin, studied the readout, and injected me
with something new. I had a diagnostic crotch. I wasn&rsquo;t sure
how I felt about that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carl
happened.&rdquo; Cassandra Cautery leaned forward and spat something
into the water. I felt a little shocked. Things must be serious, if
Cassandra Cautery was doing that. &ldquo;He busted in and kicked the
snot out of us, that&rsquo;s what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he
looking for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God,&rdquo;
she said, staring at the cord dangling from my groin. &ldquo;Whose
idea was it to put that there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo;
said Jason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to
sell these things,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you put a <em>port</em>
in the <em>dick</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nerve
routing transport&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell you what you can do with the nerve routing transport.&rdquo;
Cassandra Cautery&rsquo;s chest hitched. Her one eye that wasn&rsquo;t
covered by a bloody towel watered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God,&rdquo;
said Jason. The assistants shuffled back.</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery&rsquo;s
eye fixed on me. &ldquo;I went to Yale.&rdquo; Her voice shook. &ldquo;You
know that? One time after Advanced Antitrust, the lecturer took me
aside and said out of all the students, I was the most likely to
succeed, because while they were good on theory, I had a <em>relentless
desire to organize</em>. Her words. She told me she was going to
<em>follow my career with interest</em>.&rdquo; She squeezed closed her
eye. A tear slipped down her cheek. Her eye popped open. &ldquo;And
<em>look at this shit!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room fell
silent but for the labored breathing of green-swathed men struggling
to connect me to an artificial arm. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
okay,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s... under control.&rdquo; But
I didn&rsquo;t think it was.</p>
