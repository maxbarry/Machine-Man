about her corporate performance. <em>Why is this happening to me? I&rsquo;m
organized. I score highly in tests</em>. &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carl
happened.&rdquo; Cassandra Cautery leaned forward and spat something
between her knees. I felt shocked. Things must be serious, if
Cassandra Cautery was doing that. &ldquo;He busted in and knocked us
around, that&rsquo;s what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for
me?&rdquo; I glanced over my shoulder, in case he was there, standing
at the end of the corridor with his sledgehammer fists, ready to
finish the job he started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s
the thing. He found you. We couldn&rsquo;t stop him. He stood right
beside your little bed there. I swear to God, I thought he was about
to put his fist right through your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He did
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought
you said he wanted to kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said he
was nuts. I&rsquo;m not, you know, an expert on what passes for logic
in Carl&rsquo;s head.&rdquo; She stared at her ankle. &ldquo;Next
time you see him, you ask him what he thinks he&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;
She looked at me. &ldquo;Check that. Next time you see him, just kill
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
<em>you</em> kill him,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the ones with
guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery
glanced at my arm. &ldquo;Actually...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
