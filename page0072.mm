<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Cassandra
Cautery said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re your parts.&rdquo; She spread her
arms. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to get? They&rsquo;re your parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded. &ldquo;My parts. Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know who I&rsquo;m mad at?&rdquo;
said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I blinked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick Peters. Your boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Right.
Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery leaned forward. We
were in her office again. This time she was on the sofa. Her office
had a leather sofa. I may not have mentioned that earlier. Also the
office was also very large, one wall was glass, and the shelves were
lined with thick red and green books. There was some kind of trophy
acting as a bookend. &ldquo;You know it was Dick who authorized this
procedure on Carl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked away, because this did not
sound very true. &ldquo;No, I did not know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come
here. Sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know your legs, Charlie, and
you can sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. I could, if for some
reason I felt the urge to collapse backward. But it seemed silly when
I was already comfortably seated in the Contours harness. It must be
a social thing.</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery patted the sofa
beside her. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not easy. I essentially had to
perform a controlled fall. The sofa caught me with a <em>whoof</em>,
then creaked alarmingly until I shuffled down far enough to
shift off most of the Contours weight.</p>
<p>Cassandra put her hand on my thigh.
This registered as a kind of non-specific tingling, like standing
outside before a thunderclap. The Contours didn&rsquo;t have much in
the way of pressure sensors down there. &ldquo;Charlie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fix this. I want you
to know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t say anything. But
still, I felt comforted.</p>
