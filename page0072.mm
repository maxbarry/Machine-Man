<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Cassandra
Cautery said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re your parts.&rdquo; She spread her
arms. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to get? They&rsquo;re your parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded. &ldquo;My parts. Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a sister once. She used to
borrow my clothes. I&rsquo;d be looking for this one particular belt,
and she&rsquo;d walk in wearing it.&rdquo; She shook her head. We
were in her office again. This time she was on the sofa. Her office
had a sofa. I may not have mentioned that earlier. It was green
leather. Also her office was very spacious, one wall was glass, and
the shelves were lined with thick red and green books. Some kind of
trophy acted as a bookend on the top shelf. The place had a quiet,
musty kind of feel I would not have naturally associated with
Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;Drove me insane. And that was just
<em>clothes</em>.&rdquo; She sighed.
&ldquo;You know who I&rsquo;m mad at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded. &ldquo;Lola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I blinked, lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick Peters. Your boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Right. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery leaned forward. &ldquo;You
know it was Dick who authorized this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked away, because this did not
sound very true. &ldquo;No, I did not know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was.&rdquo; She put her hands
together, as if about to pray. &ldquo;Charlie, I will fix this.
You&rsquo;re my brain. Anything that upsets you, I will fix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t reply. But still, I
felt comforted.</p>
