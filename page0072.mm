<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Cassandra
Cautery said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re your parts.&rdquo; She spread her
arms. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to get? They&rsquo;re your parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded. &ldquo;My parts. Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a sister once. She used to
borrow my clothes. I&rsquo;d be looking for this one particular belt,
and she&rsquo;d walk in wearing it.&rdquo; She shook her head. &ldquo;It
drove me insane.&rdquo; We were in her office again. This time she
was on the sofa. Her office had a sofa. I may not have mentioned that
earlier. It was green leather. Also her office was very spacious, one
wall was glass, and the shelves were lined with thick red and green
books. Some kind of trophy acted as a bookend on the top shelf. The
place had a quiet, musty feel I would not have naturally associated
with Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;And that was just <em>clothes</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p> She
sighed. &ldquo;You know who I&rsquo;m mad at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded. &ldquo;Lola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated. &ldquo;No, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your boss. Dick Peters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; I could never
remember that guy. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery leaned forward. &ldquo;You
know it was Dick who authorized Carl&rsquo;s arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked away, because this did not
sound very true. &ldquo;No, I did not know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was.&rdquo; Silence.
&ldquo;Charlie. Charlie.&rdquo; I looked at her. She had her hands
together, as if about to pray. &ldquo;I will fix this. You&rsquo;re
my brain. Anything that upsets you, I&rsquo;ll fix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name it.&rdquo; She leaned back.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious. What do you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I eyed her. If there was deception
here, I couldn&rsquo;t see it. I bit my lip. &ldquo;Well...&rdquo;
And then I said something I&rsquo;m not very proud of.</p>
