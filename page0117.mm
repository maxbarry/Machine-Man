<p>Lola&rsquo;s chest
rose and fell like a heaving sea. This would have been quite erotic
had there not been a Better Future Combat Augmentation powering up
inside her chest. Since there was, not so much. &ldquo;Try to lower
your heart rate,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Think about something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did
they put in there? <em>What is it doing?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about
those dogs of Angelica&rsquo;s? They&rsquo;re so cute and soft.&rdquo;
At this moment, they began howling. Paws came scampering up the
hallway, thumped into the door, then fled. Those useless fur sacks.
They were not helping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Help me!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Okay.
Let&rsquo;s think about this. It&rsquo;s probably some kind of
weapon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what they&rsquo;re doing. Better Future. They&rsquo;re trialing parts
for super-soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes bulged.
&ldquo;In <em>me</em>? <em>In</em> me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just
as pissed, when I found out,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I
kicked the Manager through that window. But the point is, it probably
won&rsquo;t hurt you. It will hurt other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not a super-soldier, Charlie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know
you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo; I became aware of a tone: a whine so
high-pitched it was only just entering detectable range. That
explained the dogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
bomb.&rdquo; Lola&rsquo;s lips were turning blue. &ldquo;Oh God. It&rsquo;s
a bomb, I can feel it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmm, I don&rsquo;t
think so. Not cost-effective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you
want to blow something up, is the best way to do it really to go to
all the trouble of surgically installing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>It&rsquo;s
shaking!</em>&rdquo; Lola shrieked. Her teeth chattered. &ldquo;Run,
Charlie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just need
to lower your heart rate. You can do it, Lola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe in
you. You can&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please!
Run!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelica&rsquo;s
voice came down the hall, over the howling of the dogs. &ldquo;What
the hell is happening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not running, Lola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But
Charlie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we have
here is a technical problem. And&mdash;&rdquo; There was more to this
sentence. I had a little speech forming about how we were two
rational people and there was nothing we couldn&rsquo;t solve. But
before I could get it out, Lola exploded.</p>
