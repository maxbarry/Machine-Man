<p>Lola&rsquo;s eyes
grew huge. She reached like 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Her chest rose and
fell. Her hands trembled and clutched at the curtains. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Shall we
have Lola go ballistic? Knock out the legs? I kinda think yes. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Lola wants
to get jiggy, Charlie making excuses. There&rsquo;s that magnetic
force again, which is a good excuse. So Charlie maybe leaps on that,
but Lola sees that he&rsquo;s happy about it. Then Charlie says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
having an issue with the legs.&rdquo; &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Then Lola&rsquo;s
solution is to take them off. Charlie can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;So Take them
off,&rdquo; says Lola.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;
A crazy panic blossomed inside my brain: that Lola was making the
Contours jealous. I had no grounds for this. I wasn&rsquo;t even
prepared to grant that the Contours possessed any kind of
consciousness, despite recent evidence. But I felt suddenly, insanely
sure that they were getting mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I figure the
kid&rsquo;s mattress is perfect for you,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;Your
legs can just lie on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I smiled. Lola
smiled. Then an odd thought popped into my head. The thought was that
Lola and I should not be having this conversation in front of the
Contours.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I said, which
That...&rdquo; And then I stopped, because a cold thought had stolen
into my brain.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We pulled the
mattress off the kid&rsquo;s bed and lay it beside an unrolled
camping mat. The mat was for Lola, because there was more of her that
required cushioning. I could happily sleep standing up, given a wall
to lean against...</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Lola snuggled
against me. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;We could
pull the mattress off that bed,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;And put it
next to my mat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a
mat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
camping mat. I slept on it last night. But I can bring it in here so
we can sleep next to each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Maybe Lola
starts playing with him, he feels uncomfortable bc of the Contours
(watching him). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Maybe Lola
</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
actually quite difficult for me to lie down,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of
the legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola went silent.
She was not saying: <em>You should take them off, then.</em></p>
