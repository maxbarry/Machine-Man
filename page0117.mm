<p>Lola&rsquo;s chest
rose and fell like a heaving sea. This would have been quite erotic
had there not been a Better Future Combat Augmentation powering up
inside her chest. Since there was, not so much. &ldquo;Try to lower
your heart rate,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Think about something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did
they put in there? <em>What is it doing?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about
those dogs of Angelica&rsquo;s? They&rsquo;re so cute and soft.&rdquo;
At this moment, they all began howling. A set of paws came scampering
up the hallway, bayed, then fled. Those useless fur sacks. They were
not helping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Help me!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Okay.
Let&rsquo;s think about this. It&rsquo;s probably some kind of
weapon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what they&rsquo;re doing. Better Future. They&rsquo;re trialing parts
for super-soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola&rsquo;s eyes
bulged. &ldquo;In me? <em>In</em> me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just
as pissed, when I found out,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I
kicked the Manager through that window. But the point is, it probably
won&rsquo;t hurt you. It will be designed to hurt other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not a super-soldier, Charlie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I became aware of a
tone: a whine so high-pitched it was only just entering my detectable
range. So that explained the dogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
bomb.&rdquo; Lola&rsquo;s lips were turning blue. &ldquo;Oh God. It&rsquo;s
a bomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know. I don&rsquo;t think that would be cost-effective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you
want to blow something up, is the best way to do it really to go to
all the trouble of surgically installing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>It&rsquo;s
shaking!</em>&rdquo; Lola shrieked. Her teeth chattered. &ldquo;Run,
Charlie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to
lower your heart rate. You can do it, Lola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t!
Run!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe in
you. You can&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whine had
become so loud it was difficult to hear anything else. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not running, Lola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But
Charlie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we have
here is a technical problem. And I know that if we&mdash;&rdquo;
There was more to this sentence. I was forming a little speech about
how we were two rational people, and logic could move mountains. The
idea was that this would either reassure Lola or bore her, and either
way we would get that heart rate down. I still think this was a
pretty good idea. But before I could get it out, Lola exploded.</p>
