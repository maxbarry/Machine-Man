<p>Panic swept through
me. It was not a good time to panic. It was really a time for some of
that clinical detachment. But seeing tides of blood gushing from that
gaping canyon in my flesh overrode my objectivitiy. My brain
screamed, <em>That&rsquo;s fatal, you&rsquo;re going to lose
consciousness</em>, and I couldn&rsquo;t shut it out. I couldn&rsquo;t
think. I lifted my right arm&mdash;I still had a right arm&mdash;without
any real plan for what to do with it and saw it was bright red.
<em>They&rsquo;ve skinned it!</em> shrieked my brain. It looked like
raw tendon and muscle. But it wasn&rsquo;t. It was just soaked in
blood. I got my head up and confirmed that I was lying in a red bath.
Blood was running off the sides of the table and onto the floor. I
was a water feature. And possibly this looked worse than it was
because of the added volume from the water falling from the ceiling,
but still: there was more blood than should have been possible. I
should be dead.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Little
more panic here; let&rsquo;s not get under control immediately. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Looking down, I
discovered some other pertinent facts: my legs weren&rsquo;t right.
By which I mean, I had some. I was lying beneath layers of green
surgical cloth, saturated from water or blood or both, but they
couldn&rsquo;t disguise the fact that I was some kind of shape. I was
Contoured. The other important discovery was that I was connected to
things. Half a dozen plastic tubes ran from a gap in the cloth I
couldn&rsquo;t quite see through to bags of fluid on stands and other
equipment behind my head. Fluid was moving through these tubes: dark
and red.</p>
<p>I began to reach
conclusions. The first was that these tubes were keeping me alive.
They were replenishing the blood I was losing out my shoulder. The
second conclusion was that this was temporary. Even as I watched, a
tube ran dry. Almost immediately, I began to feel woozy. I didn&rsquo;t
want to leap ahead to conclusions of cause and effect, because I had
plenty of reasons to feel woozy right now, but staunching this wound
instantly became my top priority. I grabbed my left bicep with my
right hand. It felt like a piece of meat: I had no feeling in it at
all. It was not a nice sensation. I tried to mash the wound closed.
Blood squished around the wound. It was an improvement. But it was
not a solution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help,&rdquo;
I said, just in case. That person who had been coughing: I could
really use them about now. But apparently this was one of those
situations where you have to help yourself. I looked around,
desperate, and my eye fell on the electric saw.</p>
