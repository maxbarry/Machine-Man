<p>&lt;&lt; Finish
with either CC imploring Charlie, you&rsquo;re our only hope, you
need to be top of your game to compete with Carl, or: Show me. I
think Show Me, save the former for the Friday after the pre-req
conversation. And put the crouch there too.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>, because I was
worried that if I did, the delicate porcelien of the world would
shatter and fall to pieces.</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery
crouched in front of me. This seemed unnecessary to me, because it
reversed our height differential without significantly reducing it. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>And not just arms.
We have a pelvis. A lower torso that regulates energy 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Arms.
Pelvis. Torso. We have a range.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; This week
I think they maybe prepare for Carl, but he doesn&rsquo;t come. So
then they bulk up a little more. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; The big
story here is Charlie getting new parts. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; soft
sciences: Charlie asks Lola about id. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Id comprises the unorganised
part of the personality structure that contains the basic drives. It
acts according to the pleasure principle, seeking to avoid pain or
unpleasure. </em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A low, keening
noise came out of Lola. 
</p>
<p></p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of
Better Future as a machine with eight thousand employees. An
artificial intelligence programmed to shift resources around to
generate wealth and power.&rdquo;</p>
