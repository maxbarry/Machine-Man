<p>Panic swept through
me. It was not a good time to panic. It was time for some of that
clinical detachment. But tides of blood were gushing from a gaping
canyon in my flesh and my brain screamed, <em>That&rsquo;s fatal,
you&rsquo;re going to lose consciousness any second now</em>. I lifted
my right arm&mdash;I still had a right arm&mdash;without any real
plan for what to do with it and it was bright red. <em>They&rsquo;ve
skinned it!</em> my brain shrieked. And it did look like raw tendon
and muscle, but it wasn&rsquo;t, it was only soaked in blood. I was
lying in a shallow red bath. Blood ran over the sides to spatter on
the tiles below, like a water feature. And possibly this looked worse
because of the added volume of water falling from the ceiling, but
still: there was more blood than should have been possible, a lot
more. I should already be dead.</p>
<p>I looked down. My
legs weren&rsquo;t right. By which I mean, I had some. I was lying
beneath saturated green surgical cloth, which rose and fell in a
definite legs-and-torso shape. Contoured. Also, tubes ran from
between layers of the cloth to devices near my head: a large black
box, four different drips. The box was making the slooshing sound I&rsquo;d
heard earlier. With every sloosh, two of the tubes bucked a little,
as dark fluid moved through them.</p>
<p>The second I
decided this setup was keeping me alive, the box stopped slooshing
and started sounding like an enthusiastic six-year-old chasing down
the last of his milkshake. As I watched in horror, one of the tubes
began to lighten, starting at the end that disappeared into the box
and running quickly toward my body.</p>
<p>I grabbed at my
poor severed arm and began to mash it back onto my shoulder. Now, I&rsquo;m
not particularly squeamish, but seriously, this was disgusting. I had
no feeling there; it was like handling a steak. And the sounds&mdash;it
wasn&rsquo;t the squishing that got me, the sucking or squelching; it
was the rasping. I almost couldn&rsquo;t do it. But I didn&rsquo;t
want to die. So I did.</p>
<p>Blood continued to
squirt from the wound. I couldn&rsquo;t seal it properly; of course I
couldn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Help,&rdquo; I said, just in case whoever I&rsquo;d
heard coughing wanted to step in. But no-one came. I realized this
was it: I was actually, genuinely going to expire unless I staunched
this wound in the next thirty seconds, and felt terror, and
dizziness, and regret. I felt cheated and angry at someone or
something. Biology, perhaps. I looked around, hoping there was
something useful nearby I hadn&rsquo;t noticed earlier, like maybe a
surgeon, and my eyes fell again on the saw.</p>
