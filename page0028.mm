<p>Carl the security guard in the back of the limo with me, on the seat
opposite. His eyes were obscured by black sunglasses, so I couldn&rsquo;t
tell if he was staring at me. But it felt like he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lied,&rdquo; Carl said. I jumped, because I had never
heard Carl speak before. It was like hearing a voice from of a
refrigerator. &ldquo;You told that nurse you had prosthetics, plural.
You don&rsquo;t. You have one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt uncomfortable. I tried to cross my legs, then remembered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re meant to be smart,&rdquo; said Carl. &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t you wait until you had two metal legs before you cut off
your other one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked out the window. Later, I came to regret this. I should have
told him. But like I said, I&rsquo;m socially awkward. I couldn&rsquo;t
think how to phrase the answer, which was shock. You can only inflict
so much trauma on the human body before important parts of it shut
down. Or, I should say, so much trauma <em>at once</em>. You have to
stage it, with plenty of recovery time in between. And, from a
scheduling point of view, any time you&rsquo;re looking at a long
series of sequential tasks, you want to commence the first one as
soon as possible. That&rsquo;s not rocket science. That&rsquo;s
project management.</p>
<p>But I couldn&rsquo;t find the words for this beneath the blank stare
of Carl&rsquo;s shades. I said, &ldquo;No reason.&rdquo;</p>
