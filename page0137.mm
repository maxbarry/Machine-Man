<p>&ldquo;I feel like
we&rsquo;re making some really positive progress here,&rdquo; said
Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s back to you and me. That&rsquo;s
pretty much how this got started, right? It was only when other
people got involved that problems appeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble
with Carl began when he let you and Lola Banks get away,&rdquo; said
CC. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not quite true. If I&rsquo;m objective,
there were worrying signs from the very beginning. He came to me
about replacing his arms, you know. It wasn&rsquo;t my idea. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; CC: No
more Bioreplacements. I don&rsquo;t care about that any more. I just
want to clean up. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; CC: Carl
came to BF. He said, I want metal arms. We didn&rsquo;t ask why. In
retrospect, probably should have dug around there. Problem with no
expert in a particular field, everyone underestimates it. We have a
million engineers, you talk about skipping a prototype phase and
everyone starts jumping up and down. But nobody rated the mind.
Anyway, we put Carl under the knife. He was to be the body to your
mind, you may remember. We thought: we&rsquo;ll give Carl the parts,
and if something goes terribly wrong, well, he signed the release.
And he seemed to recover well, was very chirpy, couldn&rsquo;t wait
for the new arms. Then you made me take them off him. He got really
angry. So we gave him more parts. Reinforced spine. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>fell into a funk.
We left him alone. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>, and when
management heard about that, they said well hey, we&rsquo;ve got this
repository full of parts, let&rsquo;s start rounding up a few more
volunteers. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>, you don&rsquo;t
know enough to ask the right questions, 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, to
Carl,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone nuts. And
we haven&rsquo;t been able to contain him.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;So now we
have this enormous cleanup,&rdquo; she said. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to
take this back to square one. That&rsquo;s you and a lab. We give you
all the resources you need. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery&rsquo;s
hand went <em>bloop bloop</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>...In which we hear
The Story of Carl!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Save
this for a finish: &gt;&gt;&gt; I hadn&rsquo;t even felt it. It
occurred to me that last time, maybe what I had felt was not the
electromagnetic pulse. Maybe it was my body&rsquo;s reaction to it.
Maybe I had felt the Contours dying.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; I&rsquo;d
like a conversation between Charlie and CC. She&rsquo;s saying it&rsquo;s
okay, Charlie, we just want what&rsquo;s best for you. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; CC says
the problem is Carl, Carl&rsquo;s gone nuts. You don&rsquo;t want to
run into Carl. It&rsquo;s really frustrating, she says, because you
people keep going off the deep end. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Actually,
that&rsquo;s quite an interesting idea for an entire plot. CC says
Carl is the bad guy, she wants to arm up Charlie to fight him.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re our only hope.&rdquo; &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; The appeal
for Charlie is to get new parts. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Carl is
out for revenge. It&rsquo;s those psychological problems the Manager
referred to. He thinks Lola loves him. &gt;&gt;</p>

NOTES.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Lola was looking at
me. &ldquo;Do you miss your legs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure
how to answer this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel
like you want them back?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; soft
sciences: Charlie asks Lola about id. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Id comprises the unorganised
part of the personality structure that contains the basic drives. It
acts according to the pleasure principle, seeking to avoid pain or
unpleasure. </em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A low, keening
noise came out of Lola. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I had never seen
him before in my life, but this condescending look coming from a guy
resting one foot on the accelerator of a 240 horsepower vehicle made
me want to hurt him.</p>
