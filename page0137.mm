<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be honest with you, Charlie,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;After
you killed the Manager, a lot of people were upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to
mention the car you put into the building. That whole wing had to be
checked for structural damage. For two weeks, Accounts Receivable was
working out of the cafeteria. Two weeks! It was a nightmare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;We were
wrong,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;We thought what worked
for you would work for everybody, and it didn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t
know why, but I&rsquo;m sitting here and telling you: you were right.
We should never have expanded this project beyond you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having said
that, you did kill our CEO. So there&rsquo;s fault on both sides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised a hand.
&ldquo;Let me explain something about our company to you, Charlie. It
has no emotion. It can seem like it does, because it acts through its
employees, and those of course are people. But behind them is a legal
entity that has no regard for feelings. You can insult our company.
You can poke it in the eye. And it won&rsquo;t poke you back. Not
unless it&rsquo;s beneficial to do so.&rdquo;  She eyed me. &ldquo;Like
a machine, you know? Think of Better Future as a machine with eight
thousand employees. An artificial intelligence programmed to shift
resources around to generate wealth and power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So... you&rsquo;re
not mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean...
nobody&rsquo;s mad at me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s
not what I mean. People are pissed as hell. There was a strong
argument, advanced by several key people, that we should throw you to
the wolves. My point is that the company itself doesn&rsquo;t share
those emotions. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>And and it has a
way of reallocating its resources accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stared at her
dumbly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, people
are pissed at you. Some wanted to throw you to the wolves. But I
lobbied for you. What, I argued, do we gain from sending one of our
finest minds to prison? What do we stand to lose, if this becomes an
investigation? It was a good meeting. I don&rsquo;t mind saying,
Charlie, it was some of my best work. Did you know that the British
specifically appointed a wartime Prime Minister during the Second
World War? They did. Winston Churchill. He was one bloodthirsty
bastard. Firebombed Dresden. You wouldn&rsquo;t want him running your
country in peacetime. But a time of crisis demands a particular
skillset. It requires a leader prepared to achieve victory at any
cost. That&rsquo;s what I told the board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better
Future&rsquo;s Interim CEO. Right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I understood
why she wasn&rsquo;t mad at me. &ldquo;Congratulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be
honest, Charlie, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure they didn&rsquo;t simply
want someone to pin this on.&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;But thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>amasses wealth and
power by always actings in its logical best interest, regardless of
emotion.</p>
<p>But the
corporation, the legal entity that outlives any single CEOs 
</p>
<p>itself will always
act in its own self-interest, with no regard for anyone&rsquo;s
feelings. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>They are not
emotional creatures. They 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We presented
that to the police as an accident, by the way. Many wanted to throw
you to the wolves, 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Original.
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might
recall the Manager mentioned we were experiencing a few teething
problems with Bioreplacements,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;Well.
More specifically, our test subjects were. Do you recall the nature
of the problem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remembered the
Manager telling me they had implanted a device in Lola without her
knowledge. I remembered kicking him out a window. Everything else was
fuzzy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depression.
Stress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Psychotic
breaks.&rdquo; She adjusted her skirt. &ldquo;For reasons we haven&rsquo;t
adequately explored, not everyone adjusted to their Bioreplacement as
effortlessly as you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought
you were calling them Combat Augmentations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I changed
it. I never liked <em>Augmentation</em>. It sounded like something you
choose to match your purse.&rdquo; She frowned at her nails. &ldquo;But
these psychological issues, they&rsquo;ve been very troublesome. You
must understand how frustrating it is, having a million-odd dollars
worth of experimental hardware locked up inside someone who sits in
their room all day crying. Who won&rsquo;t do any of the prescribed
tests. Although at least that&rsquo;s better than...&rdquo; She shook
her head. &ldquo;The point is: we were wrong, Charlie. We were wrong
and you were right. We got ahead of ourselves, tried to do too much
too quickly. We thought what worked for you would work for everybody.
And it didn&rsquo;t. It doesn&rsquo;t. We don&rsquo;t know why. But
we&rsquo;ve learned our lesson. I&rsquo;m sitting here and telling
you: we should never have tried to expand this project to other
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having said
that, you did kill our CEO. So there&rsquo;s fault on both sides.&rdquo;
She glanced again out the rear window, and seemed satisifed with what
she saw. &ldquo;We presented that to the police as an accident, by
the way. There were those who wanted you drawn and quartered. But I
lobbied for you. What, I argued, do we gain from sending one of our
finest minds to prison? What do we stand to lose, if this becomes an
investigation? It was a good meeting. I don&rsquo;t mind saying,

said. &ldquo;Well, congratulations.&rdquo;</p>

want someone to pin this on.&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;But thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Company
always has to make the most of opportunity. It&rsquo;s emotionless.
Purely logical. Like a machine. &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; The whole

<p>P135: &lt;&lt;
&ldquo;Carl came to us.&rdquo; No shrinks. Experts. Didn&rsquo;t
inquire further. He got angry. You might recall our problems.
Psychotic breaks. Carl&rsquo;s nuts, and we can&rsquo;t contain
him.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>P136+: Interim CEO.
Fresh starts. Shut down the program. No parts for soliders. But you,
Charlie, we need you to help stop him. Charlie shaking, his legs
crawling, thinking: Mmm, lab.</p>
