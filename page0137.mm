<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be honest with you, Charlie,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;After
you killed the Manager, some people were very upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to
mention that car you put into the building. That whole area had to be
checked out for structural damage. Human Resources was working out of
the cafeteria for two weeks. It was a nightmare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here&rsquo;s
the thing about Better Future: we&rsquo;re forward-focused. We have
an expression in management: history is a sunk cost. Because it&rsquo;s
very easy, Charlie, to slip into emotive thinking, like, &lsquo;This
guy, he murdered our chief executive, he has to pay.&rsquo; But why?
Will that actually help us? We didn&rsquo;t get where we are today by
worrying about hurt feelings. We got here by applying ruthless,
dispassionate logic to opportunity maximization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like
software,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Like a machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked
momentarily surprised. &ldquo;Yes. I suppose so. But the point is, we
understand that accidents happen. That great advances are never made
without setbacks. We know better than anyone that, despite the best
intentions, sometimes things get messy.&rdquo; She looked very
solemn. &ldquo;With the benefit of hindsight, was it a mistake to
install a Bioreplacement in Lola Banks without her knowledge? Yes.
Should we have rushed to broaden testing to include other people?
No.&rdquo; She shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Putting that
<em>thing</em> in Lola is a hell of a mistake. You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is
kicking a man out a window to his death. You see? Fault on both
sides. The important thing, Charlie, is where we go from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was no longer
sure that Cassandra Cautery&rsquo;s hair was different. I was
starting to think it was her manner. She was carrying herself
differently. &ldquo;Cassie,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really
not sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cassandra.&rdquo;
She turned her grimace into a smile. &ldquo;Not Cassie. Cassandra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was definitely
her manner. &ldquo;Did you say <em>Bioreplacement</em>? What happened
to <em>Combat Augmentation</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never
liked <em>Augmentation</em>. It sounded like something you choose to
match your shoes. I changed it. Did you know the British specifically
appointed a wartime Prime Minister during the Second World War?&rdquo;
She nodded. &ldquo;Winston Churchill. He was one cold-hearted
bastard. You wouldn&rsquo;t want him running your country in
peacetime. But a crisis demands a particular skillset. It calls for
unflinching leadership. That&rsquo;s what I told the board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
in charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interim CEO.
It&rsquo;s temporary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took me a while
to figure out what to say. &ldquo;Congratulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be
honest, Charlie, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure they didn&rsquo;t simply
want someone to pin this on.&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;But thanks.&rdquo;</p>
