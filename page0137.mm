<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be honest with you, Charlie,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;After
you killed the Manager, some people were very upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to
mention the car you put into the building. The whole wing had to be
checked out for structural damage. Human Resources was working out of
the cafeteria; it was a nightmare.&rdquo; She leaned forward,
earnest. &ldquo;But here&rsquo;s the thing about Better Future,
Charlie: we&rsquo;re forward-focused. We have an expression: history
is a sunk cost. Because it&rsquo;s very easy to slip into emotive
thinking. Like, &lsquo;This guy, he murdered our chief executive, he
has to pay.&rsquo;&rdquo; She sat back. &ldquo;But why? Will that
help us? We didn&rsquo;t get where we are today by worrying about
hurt feelings. We got here by applying ruthless, dispassionate logic
to opportunity maximization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like
software,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>She looked
momentarily surprised. &ldquo;Yes. I suppose so. But the point is, we
understand that accidents happen. That great advances aren&rsquo;t
made without setbacks. We know better than anyone that, despite the
best intentions, sometimes things just get messy.&rdquo; Now she
looked solemn. &ldquo;With the benefit of hindsight, was it a mistake
to install a Bioreplacement in Lola Banks without her knowledge? Yes.
Should we have rushed to broaden testing to include other people?
No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Putting that
<em>thing</em> in Lola is a hell of a <em>mistake</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is
kicking a man out a window to his death. You see? Fault on both
sides. The important thing, Charlie, is where we go from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was no longer
sure that Cassandra Cautery&rsquo;s hair was different. I was
starting to think it was her manner. &ldquo;Cassie,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cassandra.&rdquo;
She turned her grimace into a smile. &ldquo;Not Cassie. Cassandra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was definitely
her manner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you...&rdquo; A thought occurred to
me. &ldquo;Did you say <em>Bioreplacement</em>? What happened to <em>Combat
Augmentation</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never
liked <em>Augmentation</em>. It sounded like something you choose to
match your shoes.&rdquo; She shrugged lightly. &ldquo;I changed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You changed
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em>
changed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know
the British specifically appointed a wartime Prime Minister during
the Second World War?&rdquo; She nodded. &ldquo;Winston Churchill. He
was one cold-hearted human being. You wouldn&rsquo;t want him running
your country in peacetime. But a crisis demands a particular
skillset. It calls for unflinching leadership. That&rsquo;s what I
told the board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You? They
made you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interim CEO.
It&rsquo;s temporary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;Congratulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be
honest, Charlie, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure they don&rsquo;t simply
want someone to pin this on.&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;But thanks.&rdquo;</p>
