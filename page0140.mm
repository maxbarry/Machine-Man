<p>&ldquo;So here&rsquo;s
the choice, Charlie.&rdquo; Cassandra Cautery was in front of me,
walking backwards, as I was wheeled along the corridor. For a short
person, she could really move those legs. &ldquo;We can get you into
a set of legs, a new hand, right now.&rdquo; She glanced over her
shoulder, navigated a turn. &ldquo;Or...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped. So,
dutifully, did the lab assistant pushing my wheelchair. I realized we
were at a junction. To the left were the labs. Ahead were elevators.
&ldquo;Or we run you straight into surgery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say
anything. I felt that if I moved too suddenly, the delicate porcelien
of the world would shatter and fall to pieces.</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery
crouched in front of me and pressed her hands together, as if she
were praying. This was pretty unnecessary&mdash;the crouching, I
mean&mdash;because it reversed the height differential between us
without reducing it. There was no reason for this unless she wanted
to be lower than me. &ldquo;We have some drugs.&rdquo; Her eyes were
very large all of a sudden. &ldquo;Some very good drugs, which we&rsquo;ve
used successfully on several test subjects, that dramatically reduce
the recovery time from major surgery. Well.&rdquo; She tilted her
head. &ldquo;Maybe postpone is a better word. They make you
functional pretty much immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I licked my lips.
The world held together. &ldquo;So... I could have... new parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as
arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
She nodded. &ldquo;Arms.&rdquo; She opened her mouth, as if to say
something else, then closed it.</p>
<p>I took a breath.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so sudden.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Finish
with either CC imploring Charlie, you&rsquo;re our only hope, you
need to be top of your game to compete with Carl, or: Show me. I
think Show Me, save the former for the pre-req conversation. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>And not just arms.
We have a pelvis. A lower torso that regulates energy 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Arms.
Pelvis. Torso. We have a range.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Actually,
the pre-reqs should require it. That&rsquo;d be a good page for
tomorrow. The pre-reqs. &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; This week
I think they maybe prepare for Carl, but he doesn&rsquo;t come. So
then they bulk up a little more. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; The big
story here is Charlie getting new parts. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; soft
sciences: Charlie asks Lola about id. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Id comprises the unorganised
part of the personality structure that contains the basic drives. It
acts according to the pleasure principle, seeking to avoid pain or
unpleasure. </em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A low, keening
noise came out of Lola. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of
Better Future as a machine with eight thousand employees. An
artificial intelligence programmed to shift resources around to
generate wealth and power.&rdquo;</p>
