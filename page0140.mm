<p>&ldquo;There are
actually two Repositories now,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. The lab
assistant wheeling me down the corridor was one of the tallest people
I had ever seen, but Cassandra Cautery had no trouble keeping up. She
could really motor. &ldquo;We outgrew the first one. We have so many
parts now, Charlie. Not all entirely workable.&rdquo; She threw me a
glance. &ldquo;Nothing ever goes perfectly the first time, right? But
we can head straight there and see what takes your fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped. The
beanpole pushing my wheelchair carried on a few steps before
realizing, then backed up. We were at a junction, I realized: labs to
the left, elevators ahead. &ldquo;Or we could run you straight into
surgery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the
thing is, we have drugs.&rdquo; She tapped her chin. It was almost as
if this thought was just occurring to her now. But not quite. &ldquo;Some
very good drugs, which practically eliminate recovery time from major
surgery.&rdquo; She tilted her head. &ldquo;Well. Eliminate. Maybe
postpone is a better word. But you could be functional pretty much
immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surgery.&rdquo;
I was being guarded. I liked the sound of surgery. I had been looking
forward to it for a long time. I was just thrown by the idea of
Cassandra Cautery wanting me to have it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would
open up our options. And it&rsquo;s... well, what do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;I
think I&rsquo;d like to see the Repository first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She blinked. &ldquo;All
right. We can do that. If that&rsquo;s what you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
She smiled, as if this was totally fine. &ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s
what we&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo; She started walking again. Just before
the junction, she threw me a glance, to check I hadn&rsquo;t changed
my mind. But I hadn&rsquo;t, and we turned left.</p>
