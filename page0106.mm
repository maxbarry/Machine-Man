<p>As soon as Lola
rang the bell, the yapping began. She had warned me that Angelica had
dogs: she hadn&rsquo;t mentioned how many. This was clearly four,
minimum. And they were small. You could tell.</p>
<p>The light flicked
on. I looked at Lola, and she looked at me, and I think we were both
a little shocked at how bad the other looked. Lola&rsquo;s eyes were
sunk into shadows. Her yellow Better Future sweater was stained with
road dust and on the shoulder, I had bled on her. This was not going
to be a great first impression.</p>
<p>The door opened. A
woman stood framed in the doorway, holding what I initially thought
was a purse but then barked. More small dogs stood yapping at us
behind each ankle. They were indeed wearing outfits: little red and
green tunics. Possibly home-made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angelica,&rdquo;
said Lola. &ldquo;We really need your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God.&rdquo;
Angelica threw an arm around Lola and hugged her. Just one arm. The
other was still holding the dog. &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held open the
door and I followed Lola inside. As I stepped over the threshold, a
dog darted through my legs, and I almost stood on it. I mean, I had
to manually instruct the Contours to stop. Apparently the dogs were
not large enough to trigger the collision avoidance software. I
thought: <em>That might be a problem.</em></p>
