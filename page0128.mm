<p>I took a step
forward. My lips were pursing to form the beginning of a nonchalant
<em>What?</em> Lola was already shining with pride. Angelica&rsquo;s
eyes were on my legs. I stepped on a dog.</p>
<p>Angelica shrieked,
&ldquo;<em>Biggles!</em>&rdquo; I have never heard a more piercing
sound, not even in metals fabrication. She rushed forward, her
fingers stretched into claws. I looked down and saw a gray-jacketed
dog&mdash;Biggles&mdash;howling from under the rubber toe of the
pole. I had caught its tail. I tried to lift my leg up, but I was
unbalanced and mostly pivoted on the spot. Angelica&rsquo;s shriek
deepened with outrage. It possibly looked to her like I was
deliberately grinding my leg on her dog.</p>
<p>She hit me with her
shoulder, knocking me off my, well, poles. When I levered myself up
on my elbows, Angelica was cradling Biggles in her arms and crying.
Biggles licked her face, whimpering, and acting like he had a broken
leg. This surprised me, because I hadn&rsquo;t thought I&rsquo;d
stood on his leg. Then I realized: this was Dog&rsquo;s plan. Dog had
sacrificed a soldier to frame me.</p>
<p>I realize now, of
course, it would have been wise to keep this to myself. But at the
time, it felt important to set the record straight. &ldquo;They
planned this.&rdquo; I looked around, because I knew there would be
four little faces watching this from a doorway somewhere. &ldquo;Those
little dogs set me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden,
Angelica was hitting me. I tried to fend her off and was not very
successful. Her nails raked my face. Biggles bit me on the finger.
There was yapping and shrieking and I couldn&rsquo;t tell who was
doing what. As I tried to crawl away, one of my poles arced through
the air and whacked Angelica on the hip. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There was a lot of
wailing and I couldn&rsquo;t tell whether it was Angelica or Biggles
or maybe me. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For someone holding
a wounded dog in one arm, she landed a lot of blows. 
</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite
sure how she managed this, given she was holding a</p>
<p>&ldquo;They planned
it.&rdquo; In retrospect, this was not the smartest thing to say. But
I felt it was important to set the record straight. 
</p>
<p>and maybe a hind
leg. And look, for the record, I don&rsquo;t think it was that hurt. 
</p>
<p>tried to step back,
but my balance had been bad enough before Angelica began to wail like
a banshee, and I couldn&rsquo;t get my right leg up. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I want to get this
clear: the dog was fine. The rubber end of my pole leg came down on
its tail, that&rsquo;s all. It shrieked like it was being
disembowled, but it was not really hurt. Because it planned it. Well,
not <em>it</em>: the hive mind, Dog. It was sacrificing this individual
unit as part of its plan to drive a wedge between Angelica and me. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; I think
maybe the dog is not fine... this is a horror-comedy, isn&rsquo;t it?
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;They
wanted,&rdquo; I said...</p>
<p></p>
<p>I know how that
sounds. But it&rsquo;s true. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Lola&rsquo;s eyes
widened. So did Angelica&rsquo;s. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>But not with
surprise. She looked horrified. I looked down, and realized I had
been foolish. I had neglected my enemy. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>And in this moment,
when I was at my most vulnerable, Dog struck.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you miss
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Maybe ask
about the arc welder; Angelica wants it out of there. She&rsquo;s not
convinced he&rsquo;s changed. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Still, I was
hanging in there. I was trying. It all might have been different. But
I had forgotten something. I had forgotten Dog.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Finish on
an upswing. Something happy/funny. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lola was looking at
me. &ldquo;Do you miss your legs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure
how to answer this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel
like you want them back?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Mon: This but no
prosthetics.</p>
<p>Tue: Prosthetics.
Charlie grinning and bearing it. Kinda ominous because you know it
can&rsquo;t well, even though Charlie&rsquo;s trying.</p>
<p>Wed: Sleeping. But
I had forgotten Dog.</p>
<p>Thu: Steps on Dog</p>
<p>Fri: Ang calls CC.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; So I think
we hit an upswing here. The only problem is Dog. But maybe Charlie&rsquo;s
even optimistic about Dog. He tackles the crap prosthetics with good
humor. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; OK! What
next? He&rsquo;s clearly not going to fix his legs. He&rsquo;s going
to start thinking about Better Future. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Phantom
pain is bad. Really bad. Angelica maybe drugs him up. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Aw, the
thing is, Charlie can&rsquo;t step on the dogs any more. I guess he
can squash one with his skateboard though. Yeah, that&rsquo;ll do. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Maybe Lola
wants Charlie to rebuild himself. I think she does. She doesn&rsquo;t
realize that it&rsquo;s kind of her vs the legs. She wants Charlie to
be the best guy he can be. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Actually
lots of potential for plots here. Lola gets in touch with Carl or BF,
doesn&rsquo;t tell Charlie. Maybe she has been talking with them
while Charlie&rsquo;s been insane. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Lola has
some prosthetics for Charlie&mdash;some really basic ones. So he can
at least walk around. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Major
drivers: Angry, betrayed Carl. Sentient legs. Charlie&rsquo;s drive
to improve himself. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

NOTES.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Lola came toward
me, bent down, hugged me cautiously. I must have smelt abominable.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,
Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;RW this for
Charlie fighting dogs to rebuild legs.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I came to see
Angelica&rsquo;s dogs as a hive mind. They were many, but one. They
communicated via telepathy. If I yelled at one in the bathroom, I
would emerge to find three more, trembling on the carpet with shared
outrage. Taken as individuals, these were some of the stupidest
mammals I had ever encountered. When I walked toward one, more often
than not it would freeze, wanting to flee but unable to figure out if
I would maintain my current trajectory or maybe start teleporting
around the room. As a collective, though, the dogs were plotting
something. I was sure of it. They wanted me out of the house and were
beginning to figure out methods. Any time I entered a room to
multiple sets of glittering eyes, I got nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re
so silly,&rdquo; said Lola, scratching a tiny brown head. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
gorgeous. Aren&rsquo;t you, baby? Yes, you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They hate
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try being
nicer to them.&rdquo; The dog began licking Lola&rsquo;s neck. She
shrieked and tried to push it away, but not very effectively. &ldquo;Stop
that! Bad puppy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I noticed another
dog sitting on the arm of the sofa. It was staring at me, despite the
play-fight going on right in front of it. I got the feeling this dog
was sending me a message. Something like: <em>We have your girlfriend</em>.</p>
<p>My legs stepped
forward. The dog leaped off the sofa and scampered away. I smiled
despite myself. <em>Stop that</em>, I said. <em>Bad legs</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; soft
sciences: Charlie asks Lola about id. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Id comprises the unorganised
part of the personality structure that contains the basic drives. It
acts according to the pleasure principle, seeking to avoid pain or
unpleasure. </em>
