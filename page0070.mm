<p>&ldquo;Carl was in an accident,&rdquo;
Lola said. She saw something about the way the Flexor was strapped
around Carl&rsquo;s shoulder she didn&rsquo;t like, and began fooling
with it. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not allowed to talk about it, but... well,
obviously it was traumatic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An accident,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s so lucky, because
you have these amazing prosthetics here. I was just telling Carl, the
state of technology today, losing a limb, even an arm, it doesn&rsquo;t
have to be a disability.&rdquo; Her fingers ran over Carl&rsquo;s
bulging shoulders. I had to say, Carl was ripped. He had muscles in
places I had only seen in anatomy textbooks. It
didn&rsquo;t make sense to me that somebody who put this much work
into their body would want to remove parts of it. &ldquo;It can be an
opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; Lola smiled at
me, one hand resting lightly on Carl&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;What
you&rsquo;ve gone through, how you&rsquo;ve turned your experience
into a positive, that&rsquo;s exactly what Carl needs to hear right
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced behind me. The security
guards were still in the corridor, alert but not attempting to drag
me off anywhere. I was to be contained, apparently, not captured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you men alone,&rdquo;
Lola said, and headed for the doorway. I stepped in front of her. She
looked at me, eyes wide with surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to talk,&rdquo; I said.</p>
