<p>&ldquo;He <em>shot</em> you,&rdquo; I
whispered. &ldquo;In the <em>heart</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola scowled. She had a hell of a
scowl. I had never seen it before. Her eyebrows rotated almost ninety
degrees. &ldquo;You think I don&rsquo;t know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s <em>hurt</em>.
He needs help, that&rsquo;s why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This...&rdquo; Down the
corridor, a guard coughed into his hand. I forced myself to lower my
voice. &ldquo;This was not an
accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola&rsquo;s eyebrows flipped up. &ldquo;What
would you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because nothing that happens
here is an accident. Cassandra Cautery said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your first transfemoral was an
accident,&rdquo; Lola said. &ldquo;You got caught in a clamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That,
well...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accidents happen <em>all the
time</em>. Don&rsquo;t blame Carl just because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point. The
point is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo;
Lola put her hands on her hips. I found it difficult to argue with
her, because of all these emotional cues. I was used to arguing with
scientists, who would explain why you were mentally incompetent with
perfectly bland faces. &ldquo;Tell me the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The point is they&rsquo;re my
parts.&rdquo; I poked myself in the chest, attempting to get in on
this performance-debating thing.</p>
<p>Lola went very still. When she spoke,
her voice was low and dangerous. &ldquo;I hope you didn&rsquo;t just
say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I designed them. I built them.
For me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lost both arms!&rdquo;
Lola yelled. Her voice echoed up the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then...&rdquo; I swallowed, to
gather the nerve to say it. &ldquo;Then he can make himself some new
ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola stared at me. It was kind of
amazing, how sustained eye contact from Lola Banks could make me feel
like the biggest man on the planet or the smallest, depending on the
configuration of nearby facial muscles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
go back to the suite and talk about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at you. I
really am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more going on here
than you realize. Come on, Lola. You shouldn&rsquo;t be out walking
around anyway. You just had open heart surgery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a month and a half
ago,&rdquo; she said, which surprised me, but I guess it was true.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. <em>That</em>
man, though...&rdquo; She pointed at Carl&rsquo;s door. &ldquo;Is
<em>not</em>.&rdquo; She turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lola,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Wait.
Don&rsquo;t go in there.&rdquo; But she did.</p>
