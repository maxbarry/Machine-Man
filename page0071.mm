<p>&ldquo;He <em>shot</em> you,&rdquo; I
hissed. &ldquo;In the <em>heart</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola scowled. She had a hell of a
scowl. I had never seen it before. Her eyebrows rotated almost ninety
degrees. &ldquo;You think I don&rsquo;t know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s <em>hurt</em>.
He needs help, that&rsquo;s why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This...&rdquo; Down the
corridor, one of the guards coughed into his hand. I forced myself to
lower my voice. &ldquo;This was <em>not</em> an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola&rsquo;s eyebrows flipped up. &ldquo;What
would you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because nothing that happens
here is an accident. Cassandra Cautery told me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your first transfemoral was an
accident,&rdquo; Lola said. &ldquo;You got caught in a clamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That... that&rsquo;s beside the
point. The point&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo;
Lola put her hands on her hips. I found it very difficult to argue
with her, because of all these emotional cues. I was used to arguing
with scientists, whose faces never changed. &ldquo;Tell me the
point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The point is they&rsquo;re my
parts.&rdquo; I poked myself in the chest, attempting to get in on
this performance-debating thing. &ldquo;My
parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola went very still. When she spoke,
her voice was low and dangerous. &ldquo;I hope you didn&rsquo;t just
say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I designed them. I built them.
For me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lost both arms!&rdquo;
Lola yelled. Her voice echoed up the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then...&rdquo; I had to swallow,
to get up the nerve to say the rest of it. &ldquo;Then he can make
himself some new ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola stared at me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
surprised at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; I said, because now
a guard was heading down the corridor toward us. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
go back to the suite and talk about this. It&rsquo;s more complicated
than you realize. And you shouldn&rsquo;t be out walking around
anyway. You just had open heart surgery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a month and a half
ago,&rdquo; she said, which surprised me, but I guess it was true.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. That man...&rdquo; She pointed at Carl&rsquo;s
door. &ldquo;Is not.&rdquo; She began walking away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lola,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Lola.
Don&rsquo;t go in there.&rdquo; But she did.</p>
