<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
bother with the life story, Carl,&rdquo; I said. I was remembering
how he had tried to engage me in the Repository one time. He&rsquo;d
said: <em>You can never be strong enough</em>, and it seemed to me
there was probably a whole saga behind that, like one time he&rsquo;d
failed to free his girlfriend from a burning car, or some big kids in
elementary school used to take his lunch money. Something like that,
which I didn&rsquo;t have the patience for. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carl said nothing.
His eyes continued to glitter at me, and I felt angry, because he was
silently judging me. &ldquo;The fact is, this is just Darwinism,
Carl. My parts are better than yours. It&rsquo;s natural evolution.&rdquo;
Well. Not natural. But Carl probably didn&rsquo;t know know what I
was talking about anyway. He was a security guard.

<p>&lt;&lt; Charlie
walks over, says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother with the life story, I
don&rsquo;t want to know, Carl,&rdquo; and Carl is already dead.
That&rsquo;s pretty sad but maybe I do it anyway. &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>That would have
undermined my point. Which was a lie, of course; I wasn&rsquo;t in
charge of this body so much as cohabiting with it. Plus, at least
some of me could be turned on or off at a distance by Better Future.
I was in total control of very little. But I had to object to
something,
