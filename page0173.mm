<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
bother with the life story, Carl,&rdquo; I said. He had tried to
engage me in the Repository that time. He&rsquo;d said: <em>You can
never be strong enough</em>. This was right before he got the arms.
And it seemed to me there was probably a whole saga behind that, like
once he&rsquo;d failed to free his girlfriend from a burning car, or
some big kids in elementary school used to take his lunch money.
Something like that, which I didn&rsquo;t have patience for. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carl said nothing.
His eyes continued to glitter at me, like he thought there was no
need to say what was obvious to us both. &ldquo;The fact is, Carl,
this is just Darwinism. My parts are better than yours. It&rsquo;s
natural evolution.&rdquo; Well. Not natural. But Carl probably didn&rsquo;t
know know what I was talking about anyway. He was a security guard.
&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still no reaction.
It occurred to me that I hadn&rsquo;t heard Carl&rsquo;s breathing
for a while. Now I thought about it, he&rsquo;d been silent ever
since I came upon him and Lola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He died,&rdquo;
Lola said, from somewhere behind me. &ldquo;You shot him and he
crawled here and died.&rdquo;</p>
