<p>But the morning was
better. When Lola padded off to the shower, clad in a borrowed
T-shirt that said <em>DINO-ROAR!</em>, I even tried the war veteran
legs by myself. My plan was to impress Lola. I got myself strapped in
and staggered into the corridor, taking huge, toddler-like steps and
bouncing off the walls. There were no dogs around. I should have
noticed that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <em>has</em>.&rdquo;
That was Lola. She had detoured to the living room, for some reason.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You
shouldn&rsquo;t have bought the welder. You&rsquo;re enabling him.&rdquo;
Angelica, of course. &ldquo;I swear to God, Lola. This ends with you
in tiny pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him a
chance. You&rsquo;ll see. He&rsquo;s trying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to
get to the garage, I bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s
trying to walk on those... those <em>stupid</em> prosthetics. He&rsquo;s
changing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tss,&rdquo;
Angelica said, or something similar. &ldquo;Believe that when I see
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point I
smiled, because I had formed a smug little plan. I would totter out
there on my pole legs. Angelica would be surprised. Lola would glance
at her like: <em>See?</em> And I would be all: <em>What?</em></p>
<p>I almost pulled it
off, too. I got one pole in front of the other. As I reached the end
of the corridor, I attained balance: I entered the living room
walking, actually walking, albeit somewhat zombie-like, my arms out
in front. Lola and Angelica turned toward me, their faces matching
portraits of surprise. It was perfect. Then Dog struck.</p>
