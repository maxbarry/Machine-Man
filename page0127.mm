<p>&ldquo;Do you miss
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Still, I was
hanging in there. I was trying. It all might have been different. But
I had forgotten something. I had forgotten Dog.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Finish on
an upswing. Something happy/funny. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lola was looking at
me. &ldquo;Do you miss your legs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure
how to answer this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel
like you want them back?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Mon: This but no
prosthetics.</p>
<p>Tue: Prosthetics.
Charlie grinning and bearing it. Kinda ominous because you know it
can&rsquo;t well, even though Charlie&rsquo;s trying.</p>
<p>Wed: Sleeping. But
I had forgotten Dog.</p>
<p>Thu: Steps on Dog</p>
<p>Fri: Ang calls CC.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; So I think
we hit an upswing here. The only problem is Dog. But maybe Charlie&rsquo;s
even optimistic about Dog. He tackles the crap prosthetics with good
humor. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; OK! What
next? He&rsquo;s clearly not going to fix his legs. He&rsquo;s going
to start thinking about Better Future. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Phantom
pain is bad. Really bad. Angelica maybe drugs him up. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Aw, the
thing is, Charlie can&rsquo;t step on the dogs any more. I guess he
can squash one with his skateboard though. Yeah, that&rsquo;ll do. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Maybe Lola
wants Charlie to rebuild himself. I think she does. She doesn&rsquo;t
realize that it&rsquo;s kind of her vs the legs. She wants Charlie to
be the best guy he can be. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Actually
lots of potential for plots here. Lola gets in touch with Carl or BF,
doesn&rsquo;t tell Charlie. Maybe she has been talking with them
while Charlie&rsquo;s been insane. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Lola has
some prosthetics for Charlie&mdash;some really basic ones. So he can
at least walk around. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Major
drivers: Angry, betrayed Carl. Sentient legs. Charlie&rsquo;s drive
to improve himself. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>

NOTES.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Lola came toward
me, bent down, hugged me cautiously. I must have smelt abominable.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,
Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;RW this for
Charlie fighting dogs to rebuild legs.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I came to see
Angelica&rsquo;s dogs as a hive mind. They were many, but one. They
communicated via telepathy. If I yelled at one in the bathroom, I
would emerge to find three more, trembling on the carpet with shared
outrage. Taken as individuals, these were some of the stupidest
mammals I had ever encountered. When I walked toward one, more often
than not it would freeze, wanting to flee but unable to figure out if
I would maintain my current trajectory or maybe start teleporting
around the room. As a collective, though, the dogs were plotting
something. I was sure of it. They wanted me out of the house and were
beginning to figure out methods. Any time I entered a room to
multiple sets of glittering eyes, I got nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re
so silly,&rdquo; said Lola, scratching a tiny brown head. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
gorgeous. Aren&rsquo;t you, baby? Yes, you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They hate
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try being
nicer to them.&rdquo; The dog began licking Lola&rsquo;s neck. She
shrieked and tried to push it away, but not very effectively. &ldquo;Stop
that! Bad puppy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I noticed another
dog sitting on the arm of the sofa. It was staring at me, despite the
play-fight going on right in front of it. I got the feeling this dog
was sending me a message. Something like: <em>We have your girlfriend</em>.</p>
<p>My legs stepped
forward. The dog leaped off the sofa and scampered away. I smiled
despite myself. <em>Stop that</em>, I said. <em>Bad legs</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; soft
sciences: Charlie asks Lola about id. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Id comprises the unorganised
part of the personality structure that contains the basic drives. It
acts according to the pleasure principle, seeking to avoid pain or
unpleasure. </em>
