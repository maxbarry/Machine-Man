<p>I woke at some indeterminate time in
the night to a terrible cramp in my right foot. I groped around in
the dark, grimacing and clutching at empty sheets, trying to find my
toes. Eventually, I realized I didn&rsquo;t have any.</p>
<p>I grabbed at the light switch and
hauled myself into a sitting position. I was in my bunk. I threw back
the sheets, so my brain could see for itself. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
nothing there.&rdquo; My voice sounded thin and frightened. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
nothing there to hurt.&rdquo;
It didn&rsquo;t help. I gave in and pretended to massage the space
where my toes would have been. As a scientist, I am not proud of
this. But it seemed to help. After a while, I was able to lie back.</p>
<p>I had never really believed in phantom
pain. I&rsquo;d heard of it, of course. But it had always struck me
as the product of irrational minds. I had suspected that if you were
to plot the data sets of people who experienced phantom pain
following the loss of a limb with people who believed in higher
beings, reincarnation, and spiritual energy, you would see a fairly
serious correlation. It seemed like the logical consequences of
allowing your brain to operate without discipline.</p>
<p>And in the weeks following my own
amputations, I&rsquo;d felt nothing worse than itching or crawling
sensations. Well, that&rsquo;s not quite true. There had been
twinges. Some minor cramps. The occasional shooting, blinding pain.
But that had been easily attributable to nerve issues. I was, after
all, doing some fairly serious messing around with the nerves, to
interface them to my mechanical parts. It was reasonable to believe
an occasional cross-wire would produce pain. Not phantom pain. Real
pain.</p>
<p>But four of the last five nights, I&rsquo;d
woken to discomfort in a body part I didn&rsquo;t have. And that
other night, I had somehow turned myself completely around in my
sleep. I think I had been trying to find my legs. I could no longer
believe this was damaged nerves. It was my brain, punishing me.</p>
<p>I had to give it to my brain. It had
taken a while, but it had figured out how to fight back. It had
absorbed an impressive arsenal of pain-dampening drugs and come out
swinging. 
</p>
<p>I sat up again. The cramp was coming
back. It was preparing to clench tight my phantom toes. I had to
think fast. Phantom pain, one theory went, was caused by the brain
thinking the limb was still there, needing to be cared for. I had
read about treatments with mirrors, patients staring at optical
illusions of their whole, healthy bodies. That could be enough,
apparently. I didn&rsquo;t have a mirror. Or a spare foot to mirror,
for that matter. But I had something. I swung my thighs off the edge
of my bunk and reached down for the Contours.</p>
<p>The cramp hit when I was halfway
through fitting. I had to alternate between slotting needles and
grabbing at the air to massage ghost toes, whimpering. My fingers
shook. By the end, I was jabbing those needles in there, hoping they
hit something, gnashing my teeth against the pain. Finally, I
finished. I extended the Contour. My hoof flexed, up and down, up and
down. &ldquo;Ahhh,&rdquo; I said. That <em>was</em> better.</p>
