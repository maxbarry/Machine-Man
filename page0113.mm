<p>I hesitated.
Because, really, is anyone perfect? I don&rsquo;t think so. That&rsquo;s
not a criticism. It&rsquo;s that <em>perfect</em> has a strict
definition. You can&rsquo;t be mostly perfect. You can&rsquo;t be
perfect some of the time. You are either perfect or not. And,
frankly, I don&rsquo;t think biology does perfect. Biology is all
about <em>good enough</em>. Its driving philosophy is efficient
approximation. Which, again, isn&rsquo;t a criticism. When you are
trying to keep a bundle of DNA strands alive long enough to reproduce
in a hostile, resource-constrained environment, that&rsquo;s a fine
strategy. But it doesn&rsquo;t get you perfection. Crystals are
perfect. Pi is perfect. People are not.</p>
<p>But I knew this
would be a difficult sell to Angelica, standing here in the bathroom
waiting for my answer with a syringe full of meds. She wasn&rsquo;t
really asking whether I thought Lola was perfect. She wanted to know
if I thought Lola was <em>good enough</em>. And she was: Lola far
exceeded my expectations, and not just because my expectations were
to die alone and friendless. She was amazing. I honestly think I
loved her. So I said: &ldquo;Yes. She is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late,&rdquo;
said Angelica. &ldquo;You hesitated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? I was
thinking about it. I was giving your question due consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
need to think. You either want to cut off parts of her or you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Cut off
parts</em>&mdash;you know, I really object to your characterization.
Do you have any idea&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you or
not!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a simple question!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just give me
the meds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you

<p>Angelica did not
look convinced. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>That was a lie, of
course. I didn&rsquo;t really think Lola was perfect. I know it&rsquo;s
not socially acceptable to say something like that, but come on. I&rsquo;m
a scientist. <em>Perfect</em> has a strict definition. Could one of
your eyelashes be straighter? Imperfect. You can not be <em>mostly
perfect</em>. You are either perfect or you are not. There is no
<em>perfect</em> in biology.</p>
<p>But I meant it in
spirit: I thought Lola was everything I needed. She far exceeded my
expectations. And not just because I had been becoming resigned to
the expectation of dying alone and friendless.

<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Angelica
comes home. Lola heads out. Conversation between Charlie and
Angelica. She&rsquo;s protective, slightly hostile. Charlie trying to
reassure A that he&rsquo;s on the level. Maybe a story about Lola.
&ldquo;Let me tell you something about Lola,&rdquo; said Angelica. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; &ldquo;Just
tell me she&rsquo;s perfect the way she is.&rdquo; &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; That&rsquo;s
a lie of course. &gt;&gt;</p>
