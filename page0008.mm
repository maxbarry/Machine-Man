<p>I asked a nurse for a sketch book and
began drawing up specs. <em>Fleshing out the concept</em>,
as Lola Banks might have said. I thought about what I really wanted
from a leg. It seemed to me, as I lay in my hospital bed, that
the designer of biological legs had not been particularly ambitious.
I mean, I don&rsquo;t mean to criticize. Legs are perfectly adequate
at conveying a small biological mass from A to B at low speed, so
long as A and B are not particularly far apart. That was pretty good,
when you were limited to raw materials you could grow yourself. But I
had to think that if anyone was designing a leg today, they would
build in a lot more features.</p>
