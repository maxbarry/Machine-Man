<p>I sucked in breath
to call for help and coughed instead. The smoke was beginning to
sting my eyes; this fire sprinkler...</p>
<p></p>
<p>I tried again, and
when that got no response, headed for the doorway. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
get help,&rdquo; I told the dying man in green scrubs, but I don&rsquo;t
know if he heard me, or believed it. The corridor&rsquo;s checkboard
ceiling was invisible beyond a roiling layer of smoke, like
thunderclouds; water fell this, making it quite a realistic
ecosystem.

<p>ceiling of the
corridor corridor was In the corridor was more smoke and more water
falling from the ceiling. There were also lots of marks on the walls:
dents, scrapes, and, in one place, a hole clear through to the
adjoining room big enough for me to put my head through. I did not
put my head through it. I broke into a trot.</p>
<p>These new legs,
they were really tore up the floor.</p>

<p>I suspected that I
could help this guy about as much as he could help me if my
servo-magnetic disks became unaligned.

<p>One time in
college, I tried to buy a pack of Doritos from a vending machine. I
fed my bills into the slot, pressed C (firmly) then 4 (firmly), and
waited. Nothing happened, so I pressed C-4 again (more firmly). Still
nothing. I tried CANCEL, thinking to start over, and the machine
whirred, the steel coil revolved, and the Doritos packet edged
closer, then stuck there.</p>
<p>I cursed and kicked
it, because I was 22 and there were people watching. I said, &ldquo;This
<em>stupid</em> machine.&rdquo; It was humiliating to be defeated by an
inanimate object, especially one designed to do what I wanted.</p>
<p>As I stared at the
dangling Doritos packet, a different way of looking at the situation
occurred to me. In this scenario, the vending machine was intelligent
and I was a machine. The vending machine, for reasons of its own&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s important to know the vending machine&rsquo;s
motivation, but say it was bored&mdash;poked my buttons in order to
elicit particular behaviors. This scenario made sense because if you
replaced me with a different human being they would have acted the
same way. There was nothing unique or unpredictable about me getting
mad; an intelligent vending machine would know that&rsquo;s what
humans do when you dangle snacks in front of them.</p>
<p><A NAME="firstHeading1"></A>I
spent the rest of the day trying to think why an objective observor
should believe I was controlling the vending machine in this
situation and not the other way around. And
I couldn&rsquo;t. I had a brain and the vending machine didn&rsquo;t,
but that was classic
anthropocentrism: for all I
knew, the vending machine&rsquo;s consciousness resided in a space I
didn&rsquo;t understand. It might argue I couldn&rsquo;t have
consciousness because I didn&rsquo;t have a coin slot. 
</p>
<p>That was when I
decided there wasn&rsquo;t much difference between humans and
machines. We&rsquo;re more complex, of course, but it&rsquo;s a
distinction of degrees, not difference. We&rsquo;re all vending
machines.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Since then, I have
increasingly believed that human beings are inherently predictable.
Threaten us with harm and we run away. Warm us and we relax. Offer us
six hundred dollars a week if we sit at a desk and answer phone
calls, and we will sit at a desk and answer phone calls. We are more
complex than vending machines, of course. But the distinction is of
degrees, not difference. Give me infinite computing power and perfect
knowledge of environmental variables, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can
model consciousness. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that one day, not too far
from now, we will have definitive proof that we are all vending
machines.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; Finish
with either CC imploring Charlie, you&rsquo;re our only hope, you
need to be top of your game to compete with Carl, or: Show me. I
think Show Me, save the former for the Friday after the pre-req
conversation. And put the crouch there too.&gt;&gt;</p>

crouched in front of me. This seemed unnecessary to me, because it
reversed our height differential without significantly reducing it.

<p>Maybe he plugs his
arm, and he didn&rsquo;t really need to. There&rsquo;s not too much
blood required by his body any more? Hmm, brain definitely needs it
though. Maybe he can shut that off. Press a switch, vrrr,

<p>&lt;&lt; This week
I think they maybe prepare for Carl, but he doesn&rsquo;t come. So
then they bulk up a little more. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; The big
story here is Charlie getting new parts. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; soft
sciences: Charlie asks Lola about id. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Id comprises the unorganised
part of the personality structure that contains the basic drives. It
acts according to the pleasure principle, seeking to avoid pain or
unpleasure. </em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A low, keening
noise came out of Lola.

Better Future as a machine with eight thousand employees. An
artificial intelligence programmed to shift resources around to
