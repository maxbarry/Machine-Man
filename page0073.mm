<p>I walked to my lab and swiped my way
into the Glass Room. I probably should have headed to my bunk,
because I had been awake for about twenty hours, and after the
adrenaline rush of the last few hours, could feel the comdown
preparing to crash down. But I didn&rsquo;t want to lie in that room,
alone except for a dead potted plant, and stare at the ceiling. I
didn&rsquo;t want to wait for the inevitable ache to creep into
muscles I didn&rsquo;t have. I wanted to stay awake until I could go
to bed without any energy left to think about Lola.</p>
<p>My lab assistants greeted me cordially,
as always. I walked through to Lab 3, locked myself inside, and sat
down at the workstation. I switched on the halogen lights,
illuminating the many delicate hand-fabricated parts spread across
the desk. They didn&rsquo;t look like anything much at the moment.
But this was my special project, on which I&rsquo;d worked in between
my main project work over the last six weeks. As far as anyone else
knew, it was project work. But it wasn&rsquo;t. It was an idea I&rsquo;d
had. A present for Lola. I was making her a heart.</p>
