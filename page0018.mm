<p>I felt very
excited after Lola Banks left the lab. She was the first person I&rsquo;d
shown my prototype leg, and her reaction exceeded my wildest hopes.
To be honest, I had been bracing myself for her to be grossed-out.
And maybe most people would have been&mdash;would be. But not Lola.
She had knelt beside the leg. She had touched it, gently,
reverentially. Almost affectionately. I thought about that for a long
time.</p>
<p>It was getting
late. I was probably the last person left down here. But I didn&rsquo;t
feel tired. I looked down at my leg, the good one. Well. &ldquo;Good&rdquo;
was probably the wrong word. I mean the one I&rsquo;d had since
birth. I rolled up my pants and turned it this way and that. It
looked fat, and weak, and ordinary. The more I studied it, the more
it bugged me.</p>
