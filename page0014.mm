<h5>CHAPTER  FOUR</h5>
<p>In my second
week out of the hospital, Lola Banks, the prosthetic specialist,
visited me at work. It had to be at work; I hadn&rsquo;t gone home. I
told my boss that my leg made the commute too hard, but to be honest,
I&rsquo;d been hoping to do this for years. The company had showers,
a 24-hour kitchen, even rooms with bunks. Why wouldn&rsquo;t you live
here? There was everything you could ever need.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo;
said Lola Banks. &ldquo;What is that thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked down.
&ldquo;Oh. An office chair. Well, parts of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did
this?&rdquo; She dropped to her knees and began to run her hands over
the metal. I felt a little uncomfortable, because we were in the
lobby, which was the size of a small cathedral, and a few people
glanced at us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You
strapped pieces of an office chair to your leg? Why would you do
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;I can sit in this. If you think about it, isn&rsquo;t
it better to take seating with you than scatter chairs everywhere you
might possibly want to sit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if
you want to go up stairs,&rdquo; Lola Banks said. &ldquo;Or move
faster than a child. Or not make that dragging sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is
just temporary. While I design something better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood. &ldquo;Like
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I considered.
Lola Banks was not cleared for deeper access. But that was fixable.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
