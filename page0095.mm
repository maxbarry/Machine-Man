<p>I wasn&rsquo;t a
complete fool. I didn&rsquo;t approach from the front. I kicked down
a few fences and came at the Better Future building from the side.
There was a small industrial plant adjacent to the main grounds, and
its chemical vats provided cover. As I ran between them, catching
glimpses of the sleek, glass building, I tried to estimate where
Lola&rsquo;s suite was. Because it had a balcony. And this was
critical, because the Contours were not good on stairs. Once I was
inside the building, it would be difficult to move between floors; in
fact, given they would certainly shut down the elevators, it might be
impossible. So I had to enter on Lola&rsquo;s level.</p>
<p>I reached the razor
wire fence, raised one leg, hooked a toe in there, and tore it open.
So far so good. I squeezed through the gash without catching myself
on it, and picked up speed across the lawn. I spotted a balcony that
looked about right. I sucked in air. <em>Jump</em>, I told the
Contours. <em>Jump</em>.</p>
<p>And I thought: <em>Man,
that is really high.</em></p>
<p>And I thought: <em>Is
that even the right balcony?</em></p>
<p>I thought: <em>Maybe
they moved Lola already.</em></p>
<p>My legs slowed,
stopped. I felt relief wash across me, then shame. I was a coward.
<em>The thing is, I just can&rsquo;t jump that high</em>, I told
myself, although I knew I could. I thought: <em>If I explain all this
to Cassandra Cautery, maybe she&rsquo;ll let me and Lola go</em>, and
this felt like a really terrific idea, which could absolutely happen,
even though I knew it couldn&rsquo;t. Sweat tickled my ribs. My bicep
throbbed. I thought, <em>That really needs medical attention</em>. I
should have that seen to before I did anything to aggravate the
injury. Maybe I should&mdash;</p>
<p>Fortunately, at
that moment a Better Future Hummer screamed around the corner, tires
tearing up chunks of turf, its grill lining me up, and everything
became clearer.</p>
