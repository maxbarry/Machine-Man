<p>I was very sick as a child. I guess that comes as no surprise. I was
that kid who spent a whole summer inside, curtains drawn against the
sounds of my friends hooting and laughing in the street outside.
Afterward, when I returned to school, I walked up to the gym teacher
at the start of every class and showed him my note that said I was to
be excused to the library. He made me show him that note every single
time, even though it clearly said <em>until further notice</em>. I
think he was waiting for the day I would decide, through my strength
of character, that I was man enough to handle gym class, regardless
of what my note said. That day never came. That day was never going
to come. I liked the library. In the library, I read about trains and
aeroplanes and how they built Hoover Dam. And later, walking home, I
would watch a boom gate descend across a level crossing and know that
it did so because the wheels of an approaching train had caused the
track&rsquo;s inductance to dip below a pre-programmed level. Things
like that made me feel good.</p>
<p>Gym class, on the other hand, was fifty minutes of frustration and
humiliation. I felt like I was at the controls of some ridiculously
over-complicated machine, maybe something Soviet-era, with only the
vaguest idea of what all the gears and levers did. And I would try to
co-ordinate the levers, but there were hundreds of them, and it was
just impossible. I could watch a ball coming toward me with a perfect
understanding of the forces acting upon it and the parabola it would
describe, and still drop the catch. Teammates would look at me with
faces of disgust and betrayal and I felt exactly the same way. My
body had let me down again.</p>
<p>I know that for many kids the experience was the exact opposite: they
could run and jump and throw balls like missiles without even
thinking about it, and it was the muscle inside their heads that was
loose and unreliable and wouldn&rsquo;t perform when they needed it.
I don&rsquo;t mean to imply that they got it easy. I didn&rsquo;t
want to swap with them. I&rsquo;m just trying to make the point that
I have never really believed my body is on my side.</p>

</p>
<p>And sometimes I would pull a lever that had done one thing, but now
it would do nothing.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>And what I decided was that most of the controls did nothing. Or, at
least, that they could not be relied on to do the same thing twice.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It never made any difference how hard I thought about it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p> I could have a college-level understanding of particle physics and
still be unable to catch a ball.
