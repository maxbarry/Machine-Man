<p>&ldquo;We were
wrong,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;We thought what worked
for you would work for everybody, and it didn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t
know why, but I&rsquo;m sitting here and telling you: you were right.
We should never have expanded this project beyond you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having said
that, you did kill our CEO. So there&rsquo;s fault on both sides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised a hand.
&ldquo;Let me explain something about our company to you, Charlie. It
has no emotion. It can seem like it does, because it acts through its
employees, and those of course are people. But behind them is a legal
entity that has no regard for feelings. You can insult our company.
You can poke it in the eye. And it won&rsquo;t poke you back. Not
unless it&rsquo;s beneficial to do so.&rdquo;  She eyed me. &ldquo;Like
a machine, you know? Think of Better Future as a machine with eight
thousand employees. An artificial intelligence programmed to shift
resources around to generate wealth and power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So... you&rsquo;re
not mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean...
nobody&rsquo;s mad at me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s
not what I mean. People are pissed as hell. There was a strong
argument, advanced by several key people, that we should throw you to
the wolves. My point is that the company itself doesn&rsquo;t share
those emotions. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>And and it has a
way of reallocating its resources accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stared at her
dumbly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, people
are pissed at you. Some wanted to throw you to the wolves. But I
lobbied for you. What, I argued, do we gain from sending one of our
finest minds to prison? What do we stand to lose, if this becomes an
investigation? 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>amasses wealth and
power by always actings in its logical best interest, regardless of
emotion.</p>
<p>But the
corporation, the legal entity that outlives any single CEOs 
</p>
<p>itself will always
act in its own self-interest, with no regard for anyone&rsquo;s
feelings. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>They are not
emotional creatures. They 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We presented
that to the police as an accident, by the way. Many wanted to throw
you to the wolves, 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Original.
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might
recall the Manager mentioned we were experiencing a few teething
problems with Bioreplacements,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;Well.
More specifically, our test subjects were. Do you recall the nature
of the problem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remembered the
Manager telling me they had implanted a device in Lola without her
knowledge. I remembered kicking him out a window. Everything else was
fuzzy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depression.
Stress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Psychotic
breaks.&rdquo; She adjusted her skirt. &ldquo;For reasons we haven&rsquo;t
adequately explored, not everyone adjusted to their Bioreplacement as
effortlessly as you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought
you were calling them Combat Augmentations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I changed
it. I never liked <em>Augmentation</em>. It sounded like something you
choose to match your purse.&rdquo; She frowned at her nails. &ldquo;But
these psychological issues, they&rsquo;ve been very troublesome. You
must understand how frustrating it is, having a million-odd dollars
worth of experimental hardware locked up inside someone who sits in
their room all day crying. Who won&rsquo;t do any of the prescribed
tests. Although at least that&rsquo;s better than...&rdquo; She shook
her head. &ldquo;The point is: we were wrong, Charlie. We were wrong
and you were right. We got ahead of ourselves, tried to do too much
too quickly. We thought what worked for you would work for everybody.
And it didn&rsquo;t. It doesn&rsquo;t. We don&rsquo;t know why. But
we&rsquo;ve learned our lesson. I&rsquo;m sitting here and telling
you: we should never have tried to expand this project to other
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having said
that, you did kill our CEO. So there&rsquo;s fault on both sides.&rdquo;
She glanced again out the rear window, and seemed satisifed with what
she saw. &ldquo;We presented that to the police as an accident, by
the way. There were those who wanted you drawn and quartered. But I
lobbied for you. What, I argued, do we gain from sending one of our
finest minds to prison? What do we stand to lose, if this becomes an
investigation? It was a good meeting. I don&rsquo;t mind saying,
Charlie, it was some of my best work. Did you know that the British
specifically appointed a wartime Prime Minister during the Second
World War? They did. Winston Churchill. He was one bloodthirsty
bastard. Firebombed Dresden. You wouldn&rsquo;t want him running your
country in peacetime. But a time of crisis demands a particular
skillset. It requires a leader prepared to achieve victory at any
cost. That&rsquo;s what I told the board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better
Future&rsquo;s Interim CEO. Right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;Well, congratulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be
honest, Charlie, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure they didn&rsquo;t simply
want someone to pin this on.&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;But thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Company
always has to make the most of opportunity. It&rsquo;s emotionless.
Purely logical. Like a machine. &gt;&gt;</p>

<p></p>
<p>with
Bioreplacements,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;Well. More

<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; The whole
time, ever since I heard Angelica on the phone, louder since the
white Better Future and a drumbeat since Cautery: parts. &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>P135: &lt;&lt;
&ldquo;Carl came to us.&rdquo; No shrinks. Experts. Didn&rsquo;t
inquire further. He got angry. You might recall our problems.
Psychotic breaks. Carl&rsquo;s nuts, and we can&rsquo;t contain
him.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>P136+: Interim CEO.
Fresh starts. Shut down the program. No parts for soliders. But you,
Charlie, we need you to help stop him. Charlie shaking, his legs
crawling, thinking: Mmm, lab.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel like
we&rsquo;re making some really positive progress here,&rdquo; said
Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s back to you and me. That&rsquo;s
pretty much how this got started, right? It was only when other
people got involved that problems appeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble
with Carl began when he let you and Lola Banks get away,&rdquo; said
CC. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not quite true. If I&rsquo;m objective,
there were worrying signs from the very beginning. He came to me
about replacing his arms, you know. It wasn&rsquo;t my idea. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; CC: No
more Bioreplacements. I don&rsquo;t care about that any more. I just
want to clean up. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; CC: Carl
came to BF. He said, I want metal arms. We didn&rsquo;t ask why. In
retrospect, probably should have dug around there. Problem with no
expert in a particular field, everyone underestimates it. We have a
million engineers, you talk about skipping a prototype phase and
everyone starts jumping up and down. But nobody rated the mind.
Anyway, we put Carl under the knife. He was to be the body to your
mind, you may remember. We thought: we&rsquo;ll give Carl the parts,
and if something goes terribly wrong, well, he signed the release.
And he seemed to recover well, was very chirpy, couldn&rsquo;t wait
for the new arms. Then you made me take them off him. He got really
angry. So we gave him more parts. Reinforced spine. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>fell into a funk.
We left him alone. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>, and when
management heard about that, they said well hey, we&rsquo;ve got this
repository full of parts, let&rsquo;s start rounding up a few more
volunteers. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>, you don&rsquo;t
know enough to ask the right questions, 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, to
Carl,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone nuts. And
we haven&rsquo;t been able to contain him.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;So now we
have this enormous cleanup,&rdquo; she said. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to
take this back to square one. That&rsquo;s you and a lab. We give you
all the resources you need. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery&rsquo;s
hand went <em>bloop bloop</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>...In which we hear
The Story of Carl!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Save
this for a finish: &gt;&gt;&gt; I hadn&rsquo;t even felt it. It
occurred to me that last time, maybe what I had felt was not the
electromagnetic pulse. Maybe it was my body&rsquo;s reaction to it.
Maybe I had felt the Contours dying.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; I&rsquo;d
like a conversation between Charlie and CC. She&rsquo;s saying it&rsquo;s
okay, Charlie, we just want what&rsquo;s best for you. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; CC says
the problem is Carl, Carl&rsquo;s gone nuts. You don&rsquo;t want to
run into Carl. It&rsquo;s really frustrating, she says, because you
people keep going off the deep end. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Actually,
that&rsquo;s quite an interesting idea for an entire plot. CC says
Carl is the bad guy, she wants to arm up Charlie to fight him.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re our only hope.&rdquo; &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; The appeal
for Charlie is to get new parts. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Carl is
out for revenge. It&rsquo;s those psychological problems the Manager
referred to. He thinks Lola loves him. &gt;&gt;</p>

NOTES.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Lola was looking at
me. &ldquo;Do you miss your legs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure
how to answer this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel
like you want them back?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; soft
sciences: Charlie asks Lola about id. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Id comprises the unorganised
part of the personality structure that contains the basic drives. It
acts according to the pleasure principle, seeking to avoid pain or
unpleasure. </em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A low, keening
noise came out of Lola. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I had never seen
him before in my life, but this condescending look coming from a guy
resting one foot on the accelerator of a 240 horsepower vehicle made
me want to hurt him.</p>
