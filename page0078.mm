<p>&ldquo;I feel like we should bring some
other people in on this,&rdquo; Jason said. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re
going to be talking about surgery.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, though. It&rsquo;s
dangerous to make destructive changes in an experimental project with
limited resources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded firmly. &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I only have one brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; He leaned forward.
&ldquo;There are things we could do with computer modeling&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;But I take your point. It&rsquo;s
not smart to make irreversible changes.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think there&rsquo;s an
ethical problem with that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jason looked at his monitor. &ldquo;What
do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; I
said.

<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you go,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Your arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I touched them, etc. &ldquo;What about
Carl? What arms did you give him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assume you didn&rsquo;t push
him out the door with no arms,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Did you take him
to a clinic or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery was silent a moment.
&ldquo;You remember, Charlie, we had a discussion about what to do
with Carl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. And I asked you to
fire him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t say <em>fire</em>.
You said <em>get rid of</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo;
said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;Yeah. I know. Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;So where&rsquo;s Carl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taken care of,&rdquo; said
Cassandra Cautery.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Taken care of.&rdquo; She
smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you wanted, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But
what arms did you give him?</p>
<p>I nodded. &ldquo;Did you give him some
other arms?

NOTES.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; He&rsquo;s mad at Lola. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come
here. Sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can. I know your legs,
Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was right: I could sit, if for some
reason I felt the urge to collapse backward. But it seemed a silly
thing to do when I was comfortably seated in the Contours&rsquo;
harness.</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery patted the sofa
beside her. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be a social thing. I 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was not easy. I essentially had to
perform a controlled fall. The sofa caught me with a <em>whoof</em>,
then groaned like a ship at sea until I shuffled down to shift
off most of the Contours weight.</p>
<p>Cassandra put her hand on my thigh. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s guilt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s activity in the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Which the literature says is highly
correlated with guilt, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I fastened my Better Future robe.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say we were to take the ventromedial prefrontal
cortex out of the picture. What would we expect to happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppress it. Drug it. Cut it
out. Something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; Jason said. He
clicked his mouse. &ldquo;Well, according to Krajbich et al, you
would become less sensitive to guilt, while leaving your other social
functions unaffected. They did some experiments with patients
suffering from VMPFC damage, asked them to play social trust and
betrayal games. The patients tended to donate less, betray other
players more often, and prioritize their self-interest higher. Those
are activities implied by lesser feelings of guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The results are quite startling.
They were actually able to quantify guilt. Look at this. See the
control group? Regular people have a guilt score of 202. The VMPFC
patients scored 27.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all other emotions were
unaffected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it says.&rdquo;
He leaned closer. &ldquo;Oh. Wait. Envy. Envy&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Envy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, no, that&rsquo;s
within the margin of error,&rdquo; Jason said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
probably just a statistical fluke.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think there&rsquo;s an
ethical problem with this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jason looked at his monitor. &ldquo;What
do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As I waited for
Jason&rsquo;s verdict, I realized I had acted this way toward him,
too. I had crushed one of my legs in front of him, and hadn&rsquo;t
thought how that might have affected him. I had just assumed he would
understand it was for science. But maybe he
