<p>When I got back to my bunk room, I
found a message taped to the door. <em>Can I see you? Lola.</em></p>
<p>I peeled the message off and slipped it
into a pocket. I had a bad feeling about this. The feeling was I was
about to get into trouble over Carl.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, I was knocking on
the door to her suite. The door cracked open. Lola smiled up at me.
Her yellow sweater said: VISION + DARING + TEAMWORK = BETTER FUTURE.
&ldquo;Hey! What&rsquo;s the matter? You look upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; I needed that
helmet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just... I got your note, and I&rsquo;m
wondering what&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think something&rsquo;s
wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you had to see me about
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. I just said
I wanted to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Oh.&rdquo; I was so
relieved, I laughed a little. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola shifted from one foot to the
other. &ldquo;I want to see you, that means something must be wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. But if you
want to see me, you can drop by any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do drop by,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I drop by, like, three times a day. You&rsquo;re always at
work. Or sleeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I know you&rsquo;re busy.
You&rsquo;re doing important stuff. But...&rdquo; Her voice lowered.
&ldquo;I want to see you, Charlie. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me. It&rsquo;s not for the
free sweaters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well... I want to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come in.&rdquo; Her hand
closed on my shirt. And I grinned, because Lola liked me more than I
thought, and that was an intoxicating feeling. That was early-stage
romantic love, right there: the delirious discovery of your own
worth, through the eyes of another. I should map that, for the
helmet.</p>
