<p>&lt;&lt; Charlie
realizes Carl doesn&rsquo;t sound that insane. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt nervous. I
felt sick. I felt angry.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t
going to mention this until you were used to the weapon, because I
didn&rsquo;t want you running off after Carl without knowing what
you&rsquo;re doing. But if you won&rsquo;t listen to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not running after Carl! What is wrong with you? <em>I will not shoot
Carl!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Nobody realized
this, I guess, or at least nobody planned on him using one, which is
going to cost someone their job.

<p>These are really
interesting pieces of technology.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&rsquo;m not
shooting at anyone, ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
not a problem. That&rsquo;s the <em>opposite</em> of the problem. The
problem is you&rsquo;ve put a gun on my arm and there is no situation
in which that is okay!&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>we had put you
through some basic training, 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>you understood the
situation properly, because it&rsquo;s really important you
understand the situation properly, Charlie, it&rsquo;s really
important. I don&rsquo;t want you running off after Carl until you
know what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I was not used to
women shouting. 
</p>
<p>Her voice startled
me: I had not heard many women raw emotion.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,
Charlie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just give it a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! I
don&rsquo;t want a gun! You hear me? I&rsquo;m not a super-soldier! I
am not doing this!&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot
express too strongly how very very much I don&rsquo;t want to be a
super-soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&lt;&lt; bit cartoony, this: &gt;&gt;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;Why why...&rdquo; It turned out there was no good way
to say it. &ldquo;Why did you think I&rsquo;d want a gun on my arm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just any
gun,&rdquo; said Jason. &ldquo;This is the Devastator, from Special
Projects. Four hundred rounds per minute, quick-changing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, Jason. <em>I don&rsquo;t want a gun
on my arm</em>.&rdquo; I tried to gesture, and my gun-arm swung
through the air. Everybody stepped back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a
<em>soldier</em>! I&rsquo;m not going to <em>shoot</em> anyone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You settle
down,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re out of
options, Charlie. You think this is what I want? You think that&rsquo;s
my idea of good corporate governance, strap a missile-mounted to a
science guy and send him after a rogue employee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
care!&rdquo; I swung the gun again, for emphasis. &ldquo;This is not
happening! There are no circumstances under which I will do this!&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Why have
they not been able to kill Carl? (a) guards like him, (b) he stole a
anti-gun gun&mdash;a thin fiber smart gun, sticks to bullets and
pulls them off course, (c) &rsquo;s got defenses against regular
bullets, (c) they tried the sonic gun but ___ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; CC
explains the gun. Charlie: why the FUCK did you think I&rsquo;d want
a gun in my arm? I&rsquo;m not a fucking soldier! CC: Look, we can&rsquo;t
stop Carl. We&rsquo;re out of options here. Charlie: Maybe I don&rsquo;t
have a beef with Carl. He left me alone, he doesn&rsquo;t want to
kill me, you and Carl sort out your fucking differences. CC: &ldquo;He
took Lola,&rdquo; she said, and everything washed red. &lt;==
Melodramatic, but that kinda thing. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, let
them look at your head,&rdquo; said one of Cautery&rsquo;s
assistants. &ldquo;It could be fractured.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t
find a way to phrase the question that wasn&rsquo;t insane. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> why...&rdquo; The
question felt too big to fit through my brain. &ldquo;Why did you
think I&rsquo;d want a <em>gun on my arm</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
