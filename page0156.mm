<p>&ldquo;Dr.
Neumann.&rdquo; Now it was a woman with blue eyes and wild gray hair.
She looked vaguely familiar; possibly we had spoken a few times about
crossover research. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re busy, but I would
really like a moment to speak with you about Lola&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Registering
with core,&rdquo; said a man, and another replied, &ldquo;Seeing
that.&rdquo; I was the kind of busy that didn&rsquo;t require my
participation. Which was good, because at this point I was focused
internally. I was asking myself questions and listening for answers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel very
uncomfortable about this. We had a lot of questions about the
procedure in the first place, and several of us felt strongly the
technology wasn&rsquo;t ready, but management...&rdquo; She threw a
glance at Cassandra Cautery, who was out in the hallway having a
doctor peer at her scalp. &ldquo;Anyway, that&rsquo;s in the past.
The unit&rsquo;s installed now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The issue is
the EMP function. The weapon. It draws a great deal of power. And we
built in a safety margin, of course, to ensure that even after an EMP
wave, the battery has plenty of power to maintain regular heart
function. We were very careful about that! We also ensured the EMP
won&rsquo;t fire unless the battery is full. So it&rsquo;s
single-use.&rdquo; Her eyes switched rapidly between mine. &ldquo;Except
that part is possibly not working completely properly. I don&rsquo;t
think it&rsquo;s anything to be concerned about. But, well, as I
mentioned, we were very early in QA and all of a sudden they were
telling us there&rsquo;s a woman on the table, we had to install...
and, the thing is, the EMP shouldn&rsquo;t have fired twice. It
definitely shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to do that. I saw the
subject briefly, that is, Miss Banks, when you were brought in,
and... and probably this was the light, but her skin looked gray. She
seemed to be having some trouble breathing. Which wasn&rsquo;t a
problem, because we can recharge the battery in-house, it&rsquo;s a
simple procedure. But before we could, this terrible thing happened
with all the shooting. And now she&rsquo;s gone. So I&rsquo;m just a
tiny bit concerned that her battery has been drained to a point where
it&rsquo;s impacting heart function. And please don&rsquo;t worry,
because it needs very little charge to pump blood&mdash;it&rsquo;s
not going to stop! I&rsquo;m almost certain of that. But I am
thinking that if the safety mechanism isn&rsquo;t working and her
heart rate reaches the trigger threshold, then possibly the EMP will
fire for a third time, which would... well, the battery doesn&rsquo;t
have the capacity to support that. So, again, this is just a
precaution, and I don&rsquo;t want to make life harder, because I
know you have a lot on your plate already, but when you find Lola, it
would be extremely good to avoid making her scared or excited or
engage in any kind of vigorous exercise.&rdquo;</p>
