<p><A NAME="firstHeading"></A>&ldquo;I
was born with a congenital heart defect,&rdquo; Lola said.
&ldquo;Hypoplastic
left heart syndrome. Only one side developed properly. I had surgery
three times before I turned two. It bankrupted my family. And I was
always going to need more, because the right side was only just
hanging in there. It was a matter of time. By the time I turned
eight, I figured out that I was a time bomb. We never had vacations,
or a new car, or ate out. My parents never had another kid. They
scraped together everything they could against the day I would faint
and cost them three hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I decided to die. We lived
way up north, a place called Chabon, and one day I walked out into
the snow and took off my coat and hat and sat down next to a frozen
stream. I guess I was being romantic. But I meant it. I wanted to
save my parents&rsquo; lives. There was this photo album under the
coffee table I used to read, looking at the pages where my parents
were young and happy and went places, and I wanted them to be like
that again. So I sat there until I couldn&rsquo;t move, and then I
fell asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I woke, I was in a hospital
bed, and my mom was crying. My chest hurt. I had damaged my heart. It
couldn&rsquo;t beat by itself any more. The hospital had installed an
artificial one. It was a stop-gap measure, the doctor told us,
because I was still growing. The device they put in was the only one
small enough to fit. In a few years, they would need to replace it.&rdquo;</p>
