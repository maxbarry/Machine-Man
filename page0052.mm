<p><A NAME="firstHeading"></A>&ldquo;I
was born with a congenital heart defect,&rdquo; Lola said.
&ldquo;Hypoplastic
left heart syndrome. Only one side developed properly. I had surgery
three times before I turned two. It bankrupted my family. And I was
always going to need more, because the right side was only just
hanging in there. It was just a matter of time. By the time I turned
eight, I figured out that when my parents looked at me, they saw a
time bomb. A girl ready to explode and destroy their lives again. We
never had vacations, or cars, or new clothes. They never had another
kid. They scraped together everything they had against the day I
would faint and cost them three hundred thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I decided to die. We lived in
Chabon, way up north, and one day I walked out into the snow and took
off my coat and hat and sat down next to a frozen stream. I guess I
was being romantic. But I meant it. I didn&rsquo;t want to ruin my
parents&rsquo; lives any more. There was this photo album, and in it
they were young and happy and they went places, and I wanted them to
be like that again. So I sat there until I couldn&rsquo;t move, and
then I fell asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I woke up, I was in a
hospital, and my mom was crying. My chest hurt. I had damaged my
heart. It couldn&rsquo;t beat by itself any more. The hospital had
installed an artificial one. It was a stop-gap measure, the doctor
told us, because I was still growing. The unit they&rsquo;d put in
wasn&rsquo;t ideal, but it was the only one small enough to fit. In
four or five years, they would need to replace it.&rdquo;</p>
