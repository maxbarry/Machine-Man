<h5>CHAPTER 
SEVENTEEN</h5>
<p>&ldquo;I have never been happy with my
ears,&rdquo; Lola said. &ldquo;Look at them.&rdquo; She lifted her
hair. I held my breath, because Lola was sitting on the bed, morning
sunlight streaming in through the window, and she wasn&rsquo;t
wearing any clothes. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re way too high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too high for what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For...&rdquo; She grinned, let
go of her hair, and slapped my shoulder. &ldquo;For <em>looks</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous. They
look great.&rdquo; I reached out and fondled her ear. I couldn&rsquo;t
quite believe that I was allowed to reach out and touch parts of her.
But I was. I was. &ldquo;Your helixes are pefectly curved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are?&rdquo; She sighed.
&ldquo;This is information I could have used in high school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rate your ears very highly,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;For biology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Ha.&rdquo; She snuggled into
the crook of my arm. Before this, I hadn&rsquo;t put much thought
into the sensory inputs of my parts. I had considered them almost
entirely in terms of what they could do. I now realized there were
sensations I did not want to lose. &ldquo;I suppose you could do
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she murmured, so
I did.</p>
