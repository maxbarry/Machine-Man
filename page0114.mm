<h5>CHAPTER 
TWENTY-FOUR</h5>
<p>&ldquo;They asked
if I&rsquo;d heard from you.&rdquo; Angelica reached across the table
and speared a potato.</p>
<p>Lola froze, a
forkful of lettuce halfway to her mouth. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve
Monovich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
Steve Monovich?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s
in Client Services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola chewed her
salad. &ldquo;Never heard of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
Angelica said, &ldquo;Steve Monovich got a call from Better Future.
Who apparently persuaded him to go around asking if anyone had heard
from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was not paying
attention to this conversation. I sat at the table&mdash;<em>sat</em>
in the sense that my Contours were retracted as far as they would
go&mdash;talking to my parts. <em>Hello?</em> I said. <em>Can you hear
me?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I
hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he
believe you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelica shrugged.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>I think you can</em>,
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hospital
wouldn&rsquo;t tell Better Future where you live,&rdquo; said Lola.
&ldquo;Would they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Pretty
sure they&rsquo;re not allowed to.&rdquo; Angelica bent down and
scooped up a dog that had been whining at her feet. Its bright eyes
fixed on me across the table cloth.</p>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t be shy. Give me a sign.
A twitch. A stretch.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;
Lola swished the wine in her glass around. &ldquo;These people, I&rsquo;m
not sure that will matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to say it again.&rdquo; Angelica pointed at Lola with her
knife. &ldquo;You should go to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You report
that they&rsquo;ve built themselves an unlicensed operating theater,
that place gets shut down within the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Just let me know you&rsquo;re there.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Half the
hardware this guy is carrying around in his legs alone is illegal,&rdquo;
said Angelica. &ldquo;I guarantee it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My right knee
bounced up and hit the underside of the table. The entire setting
jumped an inch into the air. Before it clattered back down, the dog
bolted from Angelica&rsquo;s lap. From the hallway it stared back at
me, quivering with fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie?&rdquo;
Lola reached for my hand. &ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry. Yes,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>
