<h5>CHAPTER 
TWENTY-FOUR</h5>
<p>&ldquo;They asked
if I&rsquo;d heard from you.&rdquo; Angelica reached across the table
and speared a potato.</p>
<p>Lola froze, a
forkful of lettuce halfway to her mouth. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve
Mallorian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
Steve Mallorian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s
in Client Services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola chewed her
salad. &ldquo;Never heard of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
Angelica said, &ldquo;Steve Mallorian got a call from Better Future.
And apparently they persuaded him to go around asking if anyone had
heard from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Legs?</em>
I thought. <em>Can you hear me?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I
hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he
believe you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelica shrugged.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>I think you can</em>,
I told my legs. <em>I think you can hear me.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;The hospital
wouldn&rsquo;t tell Better Future where you live,&rdquo; said Lola.
&ldquo;Would they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. They&rsquo;re
not allowed to.&rdquo; Angelica bent down and scooped up a dog that
had been steadily whining at her feet for the last few minutes. Its
bright eyes fixed on me across the table cloth. I had the Contours
lowered as far down as they would go, but that still left me a foot
higher than everyone else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;
Lola swished the wine in her glass around. &ldquo;These people, I&rsquo;m
not sure that will stop them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Give me a sign. A twitch. A flex.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what
you should do.&rdquo; Angelica pointed at me with her knife. &ldquo;You
and him go to the police, tell them Better Future has built an
unlicensed operating theater. They&rsquo;ll shut it down within the
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My right knee
bounced up, hitting the underside of the table. The entire setting
jumped half an inch into the air, then came clattering back down. The
dog bolted from Angelica&rsquo;s lap and scampered to the doorway,
where it turned to stare back at me, quivering with accusation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie?&rdquo;
Lola reached for my hand. &ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;Sorry. Everything&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>
