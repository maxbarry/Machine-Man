<p>One of the tubes
lightened, then ran dry. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Immediately, I
began to feel woozy. I didn&rsquo;t want to leap ahead to conclusions
of cause and effect, because I had plenty of reasons to feel woozy
right now, but staunching this wound instantly became my top
priority. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I began to reach
conclusions. The first was that these tubes were keeping me alive.
They were replenishing the blood I was losing out my shoulder. The
second conclusion was that this was temporary. Even as I watched, a
tube ran dry. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Looking down, I
discovered some other pertinent facts: my legs weren&rsquo;t right.
By which I mean, I had some. I was lying beneath layers of green
surgical cloth, saturated from water or blood or both, but they
couldn&rsquo;t disguise the fact that I was some kind of shape. I was
Contoured. The other important discovery was that I was connected to
things. Half a dozen plastic tubes ran from a gap in the cloth I
couldn&rsquo;t quite see through to bags of fluid on stands and other
equipment behind my head. Fluid was moving through these tubes: dark
and red.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Two of these tubes
seemed 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>not flat. They were
Contoured. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>covering a definite
legs-and-torso 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>was pushing them
into a definite legs-and-torso outline. Contoured. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>they were making
some kind of shape</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Little
more panic here; let&rsquo;s not get under control immediately. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I was lying in my
own blood: I could smell it. I raised I had been bleeding for a
while. I should</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I really needed
some clinical detachment. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The amount of blood
coming out of my shoulder suggested I would be dead very soon. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It had not
completed, obviously: I still had fingers. But it had started.
Someone had begun to sever my left arm from my shoulder. They had
almost made it all the way through. From the gash they had left,
blood pumped enthusiastically. I was lying in a pool of it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Panic jolted
through me. This was the kind of wound that killed you, very quickly.
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> It was a method
that had worked well enough in the past. This time, though, I
collapsed halfway through. I looked at my left arm, to see what the
problem was, and saw: 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>An electric saw,
its blade dark with what I could only assume was blood. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>...</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; Finish
with either CC imploring Charlie, you&rsquo;re our only hope, you
need to be top of your game to compete with Carl, or: Show me. I
think Show Me, save the former for the Friday after the pre-req
conversation. And put the crouch there too.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>, because I was
worried that if I did, the delicate porcelien of the world would
shatter and fall to pieces.</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery
crouched in front of me. This seemed unnecessary to me, because it
reversed our height differential without significantly reducing it. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>And not just arms.
We have a pelvis. A lower torso that regulates energy 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Arms.
Pelvis. Torso. We have a range.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; Actually,
the pre-reqs should require it. That&rsquo;d be a good page for
tomorrow. The pre-reqs. &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; This week
I think they maybe prepare for Carl, but he doesn&rsquo;t come. So
then they bulk up a little more. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; The big
story here is Charlie getting new parts. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; soft
sciences: Charlie asks Lola about id. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Id comprises the unorganised
part of the personality structure that contains the basic drives. It
acts according to the pleasure principle, seeking to avoid pain or
unpleasure. </em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A low, keening
noise came out of Lola.

Better Future as a machine with eight thousand employees. An
artificial intelligence programmed to shift resources around to
generate wealth and power.&rdquo;</p>
