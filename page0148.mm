<p>With my excess arm
out of the way, I was able to clamp shut the jetting artery. I&rsquo;ll
spare you the specifics. Let&rsquo;s just say it was a temporary
solution involving my fingers. I then spent the next forty minutes
getting off the table. It took this long because I had to do
everything with my mouth. First I pulled back a few layers of
surgical cloth with my teeth. At this point I gained a much better
appreciation for why Better Future test subjects were having
psychological problems. Because all of a sudden, despite everything
I&rsquo;d ever thought, all I wanted to do was let go of my artery
and die.</p>
<p>My body ended at
the sternum. I couldn&rsquo;t tell exactly where. I was wrapped in a
flexible plastic-silicon bandage: all I knew was that above this was
flesh and below was metal. I guess it was the abdomen unit I&rsquo;d
inspected earlier, but it was encased in silver-black titanium.
Etched into the metal where my belly button should be was a circular
Better Future logo. My hips were multi-axis servo-magnetics. My legs
were the black Contour Threes.</p>
<p>I was going to
vomit. Some part of me that had been silent for a long time flexed in
violent mental rejection, wailed that <em>this should not be</em>. I
closed my eyes for a while and thought about Lola until it passed.</p>
<p>I was weakening. I
had to forget about who or what I was and concentrate on staying
alive. That meant getting off this table. Eventually I spotted it: a
thick plastic handle jutting out of my titanium side that didn&rsquo;t
look like it belonged. What it looked like was a damper: a safety
switch that prevented the abdomen from powering up.</p>
<p>I lay there until I
was sure I had no better options. Then I released my shoulder,
grabbed at the handle, and pulled. It put up a fight, but I got it.
Something clicked. I heard a high-pitched whine, a deep hum. I felt
warmth. And I began to cry, because now I was going to live.</p>
