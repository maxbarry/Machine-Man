<p>The night was
tough. I won&rsquo;t recount the whole sweating, groaning ordeal.
Just let me say it was one of the most horrible experiences of my
life. I say that as someone who had both his legs crushed in an
industrial clamp. These new prosthetics, the war veteran legs, they
weren&rsquo;t realistic enough to fool my brain. They were poles.
When I waved them around, when I massaged them, my brain did not buy
it. It had bought the Contours. It had bought the Contours even when
they were in pieces.</p>
<p>Around four, I
realized the pain was different. Lola was rubbing my back and telling
me I could get through this, just hang in there, and I thought: <em>This
is not like at Better Future</em>. Back then, before I&rsquo;d figured
out to wear the Contours at night, my phantom pain had felt like
muscle cramp. It had been very distinct: I could feel exactly which
nonexistent muscle was cramping. This was a kind of pressure ache&mdash;a
<em>lack of pressure</em> ache, as if there was nothing holding my legs
together and they were inflating like balloons. When I realized what
this meant, I almost laughed. I wasn&rsquo;t missing my biological
legs. I had phantom Contours.</p>
