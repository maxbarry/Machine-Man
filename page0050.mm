<p>Then Lola stopped doing anything. She lay listless. She didn&rsquo;t
respond to my questions. She stared at nothing. And I started
thinking, well, I don&rsquo;t really know her that well. We had
shared a few intense experiences, but you add up the time we&rsquo;d
spent in each other&rsquo;s company, and it was like four hours. It
was an amazing four hours. I&rsquo;m not saying otherwise. I&rsquo;m
saying that when a person you&rsquo;ve just met completely changes
personality, you wonder which one they really are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get her to talk about the heart,&rdquo; said Cassandra
Cautery. This was later, in the hallway outside Lola Banks&rsquo;s
room. I had given up trying to get a reaction out of Lola and wheeled
myself away for some thinking time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get her to talk about anything. She&rsquo;s
practically comatose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not trying. You&rsquo;re just saying her name
over and over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I blinked. Now I understood why one wall in Lola&rsquo;s recovery
room was a big mirror. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re spying on us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;I do not want
to put any pressure on you, but what we&rsquo;ve done here, this
in-house surgery, that&rsquo;s not exactly legal. Do you know how
that feels, to a lawyer?&rdquo; She put one hand on her breast. I
mean her chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible. It&rsquo;s like spending your whole life
training to swim the hundred meters, then putting on a pair of
flippers and hoping nobody notices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t break the law. The entire point of being a
lawyer is to get what you want <em>without breaking the law</em>. Now
this...&rdquo; She gestured at Lola&rsquo;s door. &ldquo;It
jeopardizes everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her lips pressed together. Then she snuffled. It was a noise I had
heard before. I had been lying on the floor of my lab, after crushing
my right leg. Cassandra Cautery and D. Peters had been standing over
me. D. Peters had said: <em>Don&rsquo;t do that thing</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just... one moment.&rdquo; Tears began to spill from her eyes.
Her cheeks grew flushed and puffy. &ldquo;When I get angry... it&rsquo;s
a chemical imbalance.&rdquo; Her chest hitched, like a car someone
was trying to jump-start. I was transfixed with horror. &ldquo;It...
passes... in a... minute.&rdquo; She began to hiccup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask about the heart,&rdquo; I said.</p>
