<p>Then Lola stopped doing anything. She lay listless. She didn&rsquo;t
respond to my questions. She stared at nothing. And I started
thinking, well, I don&rsquo;t really know her that well. Sure, we had
shared a couple of very intense experiences, but you add up the time
we&rsquo;d spent in each other&rsquo;s company and it was like four
hours. It was an amazing four hours. I&rsquo;m not saying it wasn&rsquo;t.
I&rsquo;m saying that when a person you&rsquo;ve just met completely
changes personality, you start to wonder whether you&rsquo;ve really
met them at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get her to talk about the heart,&rdquo; said Cassandra
Cautery. This was later, in the hallway outside Lola Banks&rsquo;s
room. I had given up trying to get a reaction out of Lola and wheeled
myself away for some thinking time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get her to talk about anything,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s practically comatose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not trying. You&rsquo;re just saying her name
over and over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I blinked. The odd wall in Lola&rsquo;s recovery room, the one with
the big mirror, that started to make sense. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
spying on us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;I do not want
to put any pressure on you, but what we&rsquo;ve done here, this
in-house surgery, that&rsquo;s not exactly legal. Do you know how
that feels, to a lawyer?&rdquo; She put one hand on her breast. I
mean her chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible.&rdquo; Her voice wavered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
like spending your whole life training to swim the hundred meters,
then putting on a pair of flippers and hoping nobody notices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t break the law, Charlie. The entire point of
being a lawyer is to get what you want without breaking the law. Now
this... this...&rdquo; She gestured at Lola&rsquo;s door. &ldquo;This
could ruin everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She snuffled. It was a noise I had heard before. I had been lying on
the floor of my lab, after crushing my right leg. Cassandra Cautery
and Dick Peters had been standing over me. Dick Peters had said:
<em>Don&rsquo;t do that thing</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said. Her eyes were turning
bloodshot. Her cheeks flushed, becoming puffy. Tears spilled from her
eyes. &ldquo;When I get emotional... it&rsquo;s a chemical
imbalance.&rdquo; Her chest hitched unstoppably, like a car someone
was trying to jump-start. I was transfixed with horror. &ldquo;It...
passes... in a... minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to Lola,&rdquo; I said.</p>
