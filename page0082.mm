<p>I hit the button for the elevator and
bounced up and down in the Contours while I waited. I was tempted to
take an express route, like leaping out a window and walking back in
through the lobby. Because I could probably do that. But it would be
a bad move for the same reason I wasn&rsquo;t walking Lola Banks to
the labs: it would let people know that something was up.</p>
<p>Of course, I was being stupid. I was
assuming that Lola&rsquo;s suite was private. And this was clearly
not the case, because when the elevator arrived, it had Cassandra
Cautery in it. &ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We need to
talk.&rdquo;</p>
