<p>As I fell through
the air, the Contours extended to their full length. The hooves
splayed into three toes, maximizing their surface area. The Better
Future lawn rushed toward me, and I closed my eyes, and then my spine
tried to impale my skull. When I could open my eyes, I saw the
Contours were about three feet long and had no hooves. I thought they
had snapped. Then they began re-extending, and I remembered that this
was what they did on impact: retracted, to soak up deceleration. And
the hooves were there, too: they had just sunk into the earth. I
pulled one free, then the other, and shook off clods of soil.</p>
<p>The Manager lay on
the concrete path a few yards away. I felt sick. He didn&rsquo;t look
any better up close. Then I felt angry, because if the Manager had
had some of his own Augmentations, he would be totally fine right
now. He would be walking around on his artificial legs, and I would
not be in this situation. What kind of CEO organized a project to
manufacture artificial body parts but didn&rsquo;t try any himself?
It was a dereliction of duty. I stared at that biological mess and
was furious.</p>
<p>Ahead, the lobby
doors slid open. I thought: <em>Maybe it won&rsquo;t be guards</em>. I
was wrong. Then I thought: <em>Maybe they don&rsquo;t know this was
me</em>, and they drew their guns, and I thought: <em>They don&rsquo;t
shoot unless you try to run</em>, and was wrong again.</p>
