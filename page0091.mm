<p>As I fell through
the air, the Contours extended to their full length. The hooves
splayed into three toes, maximizing their surface area. The Better
Future lawn rushed toward me, and I closed my eyes, and then someone
tried to impale my skull with my own spine. I opened my eyes and
thought: <em>The Contours have snapped</em>, because they were about
three feet long and had no hooves. But they had retracted on impact,
to soak up the deceleration, and the hooves were there, too, just
sunk into the earth. Already the Contours were extending, raising me
back to running height. I pulled one hoof free, then the other, and
shook off clods of soil.</p>
<p>When I looked up, I
saw the Manager. He didn&rsquo;t look any better up close.</p>
<p>The lobby doors
snicked open. I thought: <em>Maybe it won&rsquo;t be guards</em>, and
was wrong.</p>
