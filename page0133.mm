<p>&lt;&lt; I&rsquo;d
like a conversation between Charlie and CC. She&rsquo;s saying it&rsquo;s
okay, Charlie, we just want what&rsquo;s best for you. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Maybe CC
says the problem is Carl, Carl&rsquo;s gone nuts. You don&rsquo;t
want to run into Carl. It&rsquo;s really frustrating, she says,
because you people keep going off the deep end. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Actually,
that&rsquo;s quite an interesting idea for an entire plot. CC says
Carl is the bad guy, she wants to arm up Charlie to fight him.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re our only hope.&rdquo; &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; The appeal
for Charlie is to get new parts. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Carl is
out for revenge. It&rsquo;s those psychological problems the Manager
referred to. He thinks Lola loves him. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; &ldquo;Oh,
shit,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s found us.&rdquo; &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; I think
that&rsquo;s really good: having a terminator-like guy after you
who&rsquo;s genuinely intending you harm. Because I like Carl but I
also like Carl hard. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; So maybe
the BF guards cut off their escape, and they&rsquo;re all, &ldquo;Watch
out! Don&rsquo;t let him kick over the car! He can jump!&rdquo; And
it&rsquo;s kind of laughable because they don&rsquo;t realize Charlie
is impaired. Actually, could have a nice moment where they realize
he&rsquo;s crippled and they relax, laugh; it&rsquo;s humiliating for
Charlie. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Moment:
everyone seems nervous, even though they&rsquo;ve got Charlie; he
realizes they&rsquo;re not nervous <em>about</em> him. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Car chase?
I think Lola busts out of the garage, Charlie in the passenger seat,
cuts off the van, away they go. Trying to keep heart rate under
control because that will kill the car&rsquo;s electronics. (Charlie
should explain this: at first Lola thinks why not let &lsquo;er rip.)
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; The other
possibility with Lola&rsquo;s heart is that it will run out of
charge. I.e. If she goes off one more time, it will stop working. An
alternative to a bad guy shutting her off. Lola could get really sick
at the end, weak, Charlie has to save her in a race against time.
That&rsquo;s pretty neat. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; OK, to set
that off, she should explode at some point. Maybe when the van pulls
alongside. Lola blacks out for a minute, airbags. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; So: (1)
They go to the garage. (2) They get in the car and zoom off. (3) They
get chased. (4) Lola goes off. (5) BF catches them. (6) Cassandra
Cautery speaks to Charlie. (7) Tells him about Carl. (8) Carl finds
them. (9) Carl overturns a van or two as Charlie and Lola are whisked
away. That&rsquo;s all pretty cool. Good action, just make sure I
interlace it with humor and human moments, don&rsquo;t make it too
grim. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; And maybe
Carl isn&rsquo;t the bad guy so much as Carl&rsquo;s <em>parts</em> are
the bad guy. That&rsquo;s a nice way to go from Carl vs Charlie to
Charlie vs Charlie. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; I think
it&rsquo;s definitely more mindblowing if Charlie gets into a fight
with his parts. A battle with his id. I&rsquo;m not sure what that
actually means. But I want to think about it. &gt;&gt;</p>

NOTES.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Lola was looking at
me. &ldquo;Do you miss your legs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure
how to answer this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel
like you want them back?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; soft
sciences: Charlie asks Lola about id. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Id comprises the unorganised
part of the personality structure that contains the basic drives. It
acts according to the pleasure principle, seeking to avoid pain or
unpleasure. </em>
