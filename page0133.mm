<p>Better Future
guards encircled the car, pointing weapons at us. &ldquo;<em>Let me
see your hands!</em>&rdquo; one yelled, and another said, &ldquo;<em>Now!
Do it!</em>&rdquo; They seemed more nervous now than when Lola and I
had been trying to drive a car through them. A young guard pulled
open my door and jumped back, as if I might bite. When I turned my
head to follow him he screamed: &ldquo;<em>He&rsquo;s moving!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold it!&rdquo;
This was the older guy with the mustache. He edged closer. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
not wearing the legs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confirm
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roger!
Subject has no legs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guns disappeared
into holsters. I felt humiliated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get them
into the van,&rdquo; said the Mustache. &ldquo;Double time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hands reached for
me. &ldquo;Go to hell,&rdquo; I said, and was ignored. Two guys got
me under the armpits and pulled me out of the car. &ldquo;At least
bring my legs, you pricks!&rdquo; I tried to twist around to see if I
was being obeyed. I caught a glimpse of guards dragging Lola out of
the driver&rsquo;s seat, and another guy peering through the side
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here... no,
wait, they&rsquo;re not the legs! They&rsquo;re just crutches!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are
your legs?&rdquo; said one of the guys carrying me. He spoke with no
strain: I was that light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I broke
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A black town car
slid to a halt in front of us. All its doors popped open at the same
time. From the rear emerged someone I hadn&rsquo;t seen for a while:
Cassandra Cautery. Her hair was different. I&rsquo;m not sure how. It
had changed from one style I don&rsquo;t know the name of to another
style I don&rsquo;t know the name of. But she looked different in a
way that made clear the unidirectional nature of time. She looked
like progress.</p>
<p>Her glance flicked
over me and settled on the Mustache. &ldquo;Where are the legs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But get him
out of here first.&rdquo; She glanced over her shoulder, at nothing
but an empty road, as far as I could tell. &ldquo;Actually, put him
in the car. You stay and recover the legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I realized that the
Mustache was nervous. Which would have made sense, if he had
initially been nervous because he thought I was an artificially
augmented fighting machine, and now because his boss had showed up.
Except he had not relaxed in between. And, additionally, Cassandra
Cautery seemed nervous. What all this implied was that the
nervousness was due to some external factor I had not yet identified.</p>
<p>The guards carried
me toward the town car. Then there was a far-off noise, a vaguely
metallic crunch, and everybody stopped. A siren began to wail; either
a car or a house alarm, I couldn&rsquo;t tell which.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo;
said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;</p>
