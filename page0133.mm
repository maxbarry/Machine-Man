<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Shh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just want
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pressed my
fingers over her lips. &ldquo;Stop thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; I&rsquo;d
like a conversation between Charlie and CC. She&rsquo;s saying it&rsquo;s
okay, Charlie, we just want what&rsquo;s best for you. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Maybe CC
says the problem is Carl, Carl&rsquo;s gone nuts. You don&rsquo;t
want to run into Carl. It&rsquo;s really frustrating, she says,
because you people keep going off the deep end. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Actually,
that&rsquo;s quite an interesting idea for an entire plot. CC says
Carl is the bad guy, she wants to arm up Charlie to fight him.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re our only hope.&rdquo; &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; The appeal
for Charlie is to get new parts. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Carl is
out for revenge. It&rsquo;s those psychological problems the Manager
referred to. He thinks Lola loves him. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; &ldquo;Oh,
shit,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s found us.&rdquo; &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; I think
that&rsquo;s really good: having a terminator-like guy after you
who&rsquo;s genuinely intending you harm. Because I like Carl but I
also like Carl hard. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; So maybe
the BF guards cut off their escape, and they&rsquo;re all, &ldquo;Watch
out! Don&rsquo;t let him kick over the car! He can jump!&rdquo; And
it&rsquo;s kind of laughable because they don&rsquo;t realize Charlie
is impaired. Actually, could have a nice moment where they realize
he&rsquo;s crippled and they relax, laugh; it&rsquo;s humiliating for
Charlie. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Moment:
everyone seems nervous, even though they&rsquo;ve got Charlie; he
realizes they&rsquo;re not nervous <em>about</em> him. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Car chase?
I think Lola busts out of the garage, Charlie in the passenger seat,
cuts off the van, away they go. Trying to keep heart rate under
control because that will kill the car&rsquo;s electronics. (Charlie
should explain this: at first Lola thinks why not let &lsquo;er rip.)
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; The other
possibility with Lola&rsquo;s heart is that it will run out of
charge. I.e. If she goes off one more time, it will stop working. An
alternative to a bad guy shutting her off. Lola could get really sick
at the end, weak, Charlie has to save her in a race against time.
That&rsquo;s pretty neat. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; OK, to set
that off, she should explode at some point. Maybe when the van pulls
alongside. Lola blacks out for a minute, airbags. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; So: (1)
They go to the garage. (2) They get in the car and zoom off. (3) They
get chased. (4) Lola goes off. (5) BF catches them. (6) Cassandra
Cautery speaks to Charlie. (7) Tells him about Carl. (8) Carl finds
them. (9) Carl overturns a van or two as Charlie and Lola are whisked
away. That&rsquo;s all pretty cool. Good action, just make sure I
interlace it with humor and human moments, don&rsquo;t make it too
grim. &gt;&gt;</p>

NOTES.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Lola was looking at
me. &ldquo;Do you miss your legs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure
how to answer this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel
like you want them back?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; soft
sciences: Charlie asks Lola about id. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Id comprises the unorganised
part of the personality structure that contains the basic drives. It
acts according to the pleasure principle, seeking to avoid pain or
unpleasure. </em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> Lola took a shaky
breath. &ldquo;When you said <em>be a machine</em>, I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a
ridiculous weapon,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I hope that&rsquo;s
experimental.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you trust
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I
do, Charlie.&rdquo; Low voice.</p>
<p>You know how you
have an EMP weapon in your chest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I
think I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s
triggered by high heart rate.&rdquo; Bright light spilled under the
rising garage door. I raised a hand to shield my eyes. Then I
couldn&rsquo;t help it: I glanced at the arc welder again. It was
shining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie!
What are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. Well,
for this to work, sometimes I&rsquo;m going to have to not tell you
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What
things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things that
might alarm you.&rdquo; The garage door retracted into the ceiling.
Beyond lay a concrete driveway, garden beds, an empty road, freedom.
&ldquo;Do you trust me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Angelica
on the phone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,
Charlie. I trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I need
you to be a machine,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;No thinking. Just doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then start
the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Lola climbed into
the driver&rsquo;s seat of Angelica&rsquo;s car. It was a hybrid, I
noticed, just like me. Lola adjusted the mirror. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
sure we should be doing this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should.&rdquo;
My pole legs snagged on the passenger door somehow. They were so
ungainly; I had to do everything. In frustration I pulled off the
straps and threw them into the back seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
even know where we&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere.&rdquo;
I pulled shut the car door. Then, out the window, I saw it: the arc
welder. My breath caught. It was so big. It was a gray refrigerator
on wheels. That thing had to be rated 200 amps. Maybe it <em>could</em>
open up the Contours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should at
least leave a note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
I realized Lola was reaching for the door handle. &ldquo;No! We&rsquo;ll
call her from the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call her
with what? Charlie, you&rsquo;re not making sense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.
All right.&rdquo; I found a remote control between the seats, and
pressed. The garage door began to rattle upward. &ldquo;Lola. I want
you to be a machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola folded her
hands in her lap. Her shoulders seem to settle, as if absorbing load.
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not like
that. Just listen. There&rsquo;s a device in your chest. Some kind of
EMP weapon that activates when your heart beats fast.&rdquo; As the
garage door rose, light spilled inside. I couldn&rsquo;t help it: I
glanced at the arc welder again. It was shining. &ldquo;In order for
us to remain functional in a high-pressure situation, we can&rsquo;t
let you get too stressed. So, right now, it&rsquo;s important that
you don&rsquo;t think too much. We need you to do what I say without
wondering why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a
machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She chewed her lip.
&ldquo;You think this is a high-pressure situation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The garage door
retracted into the ceiling. Beyond lay a concrete driveway, an
invitingly empty road. &ldquo;Lola...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;m
being a machine.&rdquo; She pressed a button and the car started,
near-silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
I began to relax. Lola put the car in gear. She seemed focused but
calm. Then a white Better Future van jumped the curb in front of us,
engine screaming, and ruined it.</p>
