<p>&ldquo;One of
the problems with legs,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is they can&rsquo;t
survive on their own. They need to be attached to a body to function.
They&rsquo;re not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola Banks
looked up from fiddling with her access badge, her eyes wide.
&ldquo;<em>Standalone?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;
I realized this was a quip. &ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like
your thinking, Charlie. I&rsquo;m just not sure what benefit you get,
in a practical sense, from a self-powered leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevator
doors slid open. My chair-leg rollers <em>clickety-clack</em>ed
over the uneven exit. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re no longer limited by
the body&rsquo;s energy supply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far
down are we?&rdquo; Lola Banks said, looking around at the steel
buttresses that reinforced the walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a
hundred feet. So obviously if you can install a small reactor in the
leg, and raise the energy supply from around a kilojoule per second
to, say, 4.2 megajoules per second, that increases the functional
possibilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are
we down a hundred feet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In case
something goes wrong.&rdquo; I swiped my card. The first set of doors
to the Glass Room began to depressurize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo;
said Lola Banks. &ldquo;Back up. Did you say you <em>reactor</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small.
Small reactor. We build those here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are
you doing with a small reactor?&rdquo;</p>
