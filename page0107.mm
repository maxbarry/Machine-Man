<p>I got two steps
into the hallway before Angelica gasped. &ldquo;Is that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guy with
the legs,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I realized I had
met Angelica before. She had been my doctor, back in the hospital.
She had not wanted to release me, called me <em>unstable</em>. I was
glad I hadn&rsquo;t known then that Angelica kept a house full of
tiny, tunic-wearing dogs. It would have seriously undermined my
confidence in her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He
shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But
just close the door, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelica shut the
front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re
in trouble,&rdquo; Lola said. &ldquo;We need your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was glad Lola was
taking the lead here, because I was pretty much done. I closed my
eyes and let Lola&rsquo;s words wash over me. I saw the Manager,
flying backwards out the window. His expression was very calm. His
eyes were on me the whole time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie.
Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I opened my eyes.
Cassandra Cautery was there. She was standing shoulder-to-shoulder
with Lola, both of them looking at me like I was something very
pitiful. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; I croaked to Cassandra
Cautery. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola glanced at
Cautery. &ldquo;You see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
okay. You did the right thing. I&rsquo;ll take care of him.&rdquo;
Cautery put her hand on my forearm. &ldquo;Come on, Dr. Neumann. I
need to clean up that arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
take my arms.&rdquo; This was when I realized it wasn&rsquo;t
Cassandra Cautery. It was Angelica. She had deep brown eyes, which
seemed to hold genuine concern.
