<p>I got two steps
into the hallway before Angelica gasped. &ldquo;Is that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guy with
the legs,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned and
squinted at Angelica. Now I remembered her. She had been my doctor,
back in the hospital. She had not wanted to release me, called me
<em>unstable</em>. It was just as well I hadn&rsquo;t known then that
Angelica kept a house of tiny, tunic-wearing dogs. It would have
undermined my confidence in her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He
shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But
just close the door, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelica shut the
front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re
in trouble,&rdquo; Lola said. &ldquo;We need your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was glad Lola was
taking the lead here, because I was pretty much done. I closed my
eyes and let Lola&rsquo;s words wash over me. I saw the Manager,
flying backwards out the window. His eyes stayed on me the whole
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie.
Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I opened my eyes.
Cassandra Cautery was there, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Lola.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; I croaked. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean
to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He goes in
and out,&rdquo; Lola said. 
</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery
nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. You did the right thing. I&rsquo;ll
take care of him.&rdquo; She put her hand on my forearm. &ldquo;Come
on. Let me clean up that arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
take my arms.&rdquo; This was when I realized it wasn&rsquo;t
Cassandra Cautery. It was Angelica. She had deep brown eyes, in which
I saw no accusation. I relaxed, and that was the last sensible thing
I did for the night.</p>
