<h5>CHAPTER 
TWENTY-ONE</h5>
<p>Carl looked
different. At first I couldn&rsquo;t put my finger on it. I was
distracted by other thoughts, like why was he even here. Cassandra
Cautery had said she&rsquo;d fired him. In fact, I&rsquo;d got the
impression she&rsquo;d maybe disposed of him permanently. But Carl
was not disposed of. He was right here, filling the doorway, blocking
the only exit to Lola&rsquo;s suite that didn&rsquo;t require falling
eighty feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Carl.&rdquo;
The light from the hallway behind him made it hard to see his face.
&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carl didn&rsquo;t
move. Lola peeked around me. &ldquo;Carl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still nothing. He
was wearing his security uniform, although something about that
looked different, too. &ldquo;Kind of a crazy day, huh?&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;I mean... I don&rsquo;t know how up you are on current
events, but...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carl stepped into
the room. Suddenly what was different about him became obvious. I
hadn&rsquo;t clicked earlier because Carl had always been a big guy.
But not this big. Not so big he had to turn sideways to fit through a
door.</p>
<p>His arms were
concealed by what must have been a custom-tailored uniform, but his
hands protruded from his sleeves: thick blocks of gray metal. They
looked like sledgehammers. I had not designed these.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Banks,&rdquo;
Carl said. &ldquo;You were always very kind to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt a rush of
relief. I opened my mouth to express this, but Carl&rsquo;s eyes
flicked at me, and I shut up again. It was clear to me in that moment
that Carl knew I had tried to get him fired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In
appreciation of that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a
head start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carl walked us to a
supply elevator I&rsquo;d never used before and swiped his ID card. I
found this interesting, because a moment ago, Carl&rsquo;s hands had
looked like blocks of stone. Now they&rsquo;d split into two thick
fingers, supple enough to grasp the tag around his neck. It seemed
they could split a few different ways, then come together to deliver
a punching force. That wasn&rsquo;t a bad idea, for security guard
hands. It&rsquo;s what I would have done, if I&rsquo;d designed them.
Which I hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it down
all the way,&rdquo; Carl said. &ldquo;It opens in the parking lot.
Then you&rsquo;re on your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola and I shuffled
inside. &ldquo;Thank you, Carl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not doing you a favor. I&rsquo;m just paying my debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well...
thanks anyway. And I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevators doors
began to slide closed, but Carl raised a hand to send them back. His
fist was a block of solid metal again. &ldquo;Sorry, Dr. Neumann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you
sorry for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well... you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For having
them take away my prosthetics? That&rsquo;s what you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was
left unable to unzip my own fly, because you ordered that nobody
could use your arms but you? That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re talking
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I had
to be hidden out of your sight, because you wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate
me in the same building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
not a problem, Dr. Neumann.&rdquo; He lowered his arm, releasing the
elevator door. I heard the thin whine of servo-magnetics. &ldquo;I
have my own parts now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lola was silent as
the elevator descended. I risked a glance at her: she was staring
straight ahead, her arms stiff. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Before we reach the parking lot, you should&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you make
them take away Carl&rsquo;s arms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not sure now is the best time to discuss this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Did you
make them take his arms?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t
his arms!&rdquo; I said. There was more to this argument, but Lola&rsquo;s
lips thinned to a dramatic white slash, and I decided it would be
counter-productive to advance it. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s address this
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevator
thumped to a stop. The doors seemed to take a long time to open. &ldquo;I
want you to know, I am working extremely hard right now to not yell
at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.
Noted.&rdquo; I held out my arms. &ldquo;Come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glared at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s
probably about to be some running,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And you need
to be on board for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doors opened.
It took my eyes a moment to adjust to the contrast: the darkness of
the parking lot, and the sunlight pouring in the entry ramp. So I
first became aware of security by the shouting.</p>
<p>Lola jumped into my
arms. I wrapped her up tight. Then there was some running.</p>

NOTES.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I once did one of
those personality tests.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; OK: The
Manager says they&rsquo;re interested in making super soldiers. He
says Lola&rsquo;s got an EMP in her chest. Explains how it works. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;
Charlie leaps out through the drapes. They protect him from shattered
glass. Then he grabs Lola and they run off. I think he cleans out the
Repo of parts, too. Maybe some guards shoot at him. It&rsquo;s a cool
action scene. Come up with some unusual things. And remember Charlie
is not tough. He&rsquo;s a smart guy afraid for his life with some
kick ass legs. &gt;&gt;</p>
