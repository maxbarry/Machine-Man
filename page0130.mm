<p>Lola climbed into
the driver&rsquo;s seat of Angelica&rsquo;s car and adjusted the
mirror. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure we should be doing this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we
should.&rdquo; My pole legs snagged on the passenger seat carpet
somehow; I tugged them free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
even know where we&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere.&rdquo;
I pulled shut the car door. Out the side window, I suddenly saw it:
the arc welder. My breath caught. I hadn&rsquo;t expected it to be so
big. This thing had power. Maybe it <em>could</em> open up the
Contours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
just leave a note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
Then I realized she was reaching for the door handle. &ldquo;No!
We&rsquo;ll call her from the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Call</em>
her? With what? You&rsquo;re not making sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found a remote
control between the seats, and pressed. The garage door began to
rattle upward. &ldquo;You know how you have an EMP weapon in your
chest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. I
think I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s
triggered by high heart rate.&rdquo; Bright light spilled inside. I
couldn&rsquo;t help it: I threw a look at the arc welder. It was
gleaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie!
What are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think
sometimes, I&rsquo;m going to have to not tell you things,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;Things that might alarm you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola stared at me.
The garage door retracted into the ceiling. Beyond lay a concrete
driveway, garden beds, an empty road, freedom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Start the
car,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Angelica
on the phone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,
Lola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took a breath.
&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; She pressed a button: the car&rsquo;s engine
turned over. It was almost silent; a hybrid, like me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not thinking. I&rsquo;m just driving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. That&rsquo;s
really good.&rdquo; I relaxed a little. Lola was in a perfect
psychological state, I thought: ready for action but calm. Then the
white Better Future van jumped the kerb and ruined it.</p>
