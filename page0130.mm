<p>Lola climbed into
the driver&rsquo;s seat of Angelica&rsquo;s car. It was a hybrid, I
noticed, just like me. Lola adjusted the mirror. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
sure we should be doing this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should.&rdquo;
My pole legs snagged on the passenger door somehow. They were so
ungainly; I had to do everything. In frustration I pulled off the
straps and threw them into the back seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
even know where we&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere.&rdquo;
I pulled shut the car door. Then, out the window, I saw it: the arc
welder. My breath caught. It was so big. It was a gray refrigerator
on wheels. That thing had to be rated 200 amps. Maybe I <em>could</em>
use it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should at
least leave a note...&rdquo;</p>
<p>I realized Lola was
reaching for the door handle. &ldquo;No! Stop that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie!&rdquo;
Her cheeks flamed. &ldquo;What the hell? You&rsquo;re not making
any&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop
talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You
stop talking! Asshole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lola, turn
off your brain and do exactly what I say.&rdquo; I hunted between the
seats until I found a remote control, and pressed. The garage door
began to rattle upward. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only way
to <em>what?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see how
you&rsquo;re still thinking? Stop it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop
treating me like a piece of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a
machine. Be that. An object that blindly obeys instruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a woman,
that is <em>really</em> objectionable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not a woman right now. You&rsquo;re an EMP weapon that activates at
high heart rates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The garage door
retracted into the ceiling. Beyond lay a concrete driveway, flanked
by garden beds, and an inviting empty road. Lola said, &ldquo;Is
something happening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Now
drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola stared at me.
Then she leaned forward and pressed a button. The car started,
near-silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
I began to relax. Lola put the car in gear. She seemed focused but
calm. She was being a machine: a beautiful, efficient machine. Then a
white Better Future van jumped the curb, engine screaming, and slewed
across the driveway in front of us.</p>
