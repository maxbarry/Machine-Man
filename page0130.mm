<p>Lola climbed into
the driver&rsquo;s seat of Angelica&rsquo;s car. It was a hybrid, I
noticed, just like me. Lola adjusted the mirror. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
sure we should be doing this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should.&rdquo;
My pole legs snagged on the passenger door somehow. They were so
ungainly; I had to do everything. In frustration I pulled off the
straps and threw them into the back seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
even know where we&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere.&rdquo;
I pulled shut the car door. Then, out the window, I saw it: the arc
welder. My breath caught. It was so big. It was a gray refrigerator
on wheels. That thing had to be rated 200 amps. Maybe it <em>could</em>
open up the Contours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should at
least leave a note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
I realized Lola was reaching for the door handle. &ldquo;No! We&rsquo;ll
call her from the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call her
with what? Charlie, you&rsquo;re not making sense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.
All right.&rdquo; I found a remote control between the seats, and
pressed. The garage door began to rattle upward. &ldquo;Lola. I want
you to be a machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola folded her
hands in her lap. Her shoulders seem to settle, as if absorbing load.
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not like
that. Just listen. There&rsquo;s a device in your chest. Some kind of
EMP weapon that activates when your heart beats fast.&rdquo; As the
garage door rose, light spilled inside. I couldn&rsquo;t help it: I
glanced at the arc welder again. It was shining. &ldquo;In order for
us to remain functional in a high-pressure situation, we can&rsquo;t
let you get too stressed. So, right now, it&rsquo;s important that
you don&rsquo;t think too much. We need you to do what I say without
wondering why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a
machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She chewed her lip.
&ldquo;You think this is a high-pressure situation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The garage door
retracted into the ceiling. Beyond lay a concrete driveway, an
invitingly empty road. &ldquo;Lola...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;m
being a machine.&rdquo; She pressed a button and the car started,
near-silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
I began to relax. Lola put the car in gear. She seemed focused but
calm. Then a white Better Future van jumped the curb in front of us,
engine screaming, and ruined it.</p>
