<p>Lola climbed into
the driver&rsquo;s seat of Angelica&rsquo;s car. It was a hybrid, I
noticed, just like me. Lola adjusted the mirror. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
sure we should be doing this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should.&rdquo;
My pole legs snagged on the passenger door somehow. They were so
ungainly; I had to do everything. To get them inside, I unbuckled
them and tucked them beside the seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
even know where we&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere.&rdquo;
I pulled shut the car door. Out the window, I suddenly saw it: the
arc welder. My breath caught. I hadn&rsquo;t expected it to be so
big. Maybe it <em>could</em> open up the Contours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
just leave a note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
I realized she was reaching for the door handle. &ldquo;No! We&rsquo;ll
call her from the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call her?
With what? You&rsquo;re not making sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found a remote
control between the seats, and pressed. The garage door began to
rattle upward. &ldquo;You know how you have an EMP weapon in your
chest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,
Charlie, I think I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how it&rsquo;s
triggered by high heart rate.&rdquo; Bright light spilled under the
rising garage door. I raised a hand to block it out. Then I couldn&rsquo;t
help it: I glanced at the arc welder. It was gleaming, just like I
knew it would be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie!
What are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this to
work, sometimes I&rsquo;m going to have to not tell you things,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;Things that might alarm you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola looked at me.
The garage door retracted into the ceiling. Beyond lay a concrete
driveway, garden beds, an empty road, freedom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you trust
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Angelica
on the phone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,
Lola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,
Charlie. I trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then start
the car. Please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took a breath.
&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; She pressed a button. The car engine started,
near-silently. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t think. I&rsquo;ll just drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. That&rsquo;s
good.&rdquo; I relaxed a little. This was an optimal psychological
state: she was focused but calm. Then, of course, the white Better
Future van jumped the curb ahead of us and ruined it.</p>
