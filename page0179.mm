<h5>CHAPTER 
THIRTY-SEVEN</h5>
<p>My left leg thumped
into the concrete. There was a pause. My right leg jerked up, hung in
the air, hiccuped, and came down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God,&rdquo;
said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;Jason, can you go any slower? You
can&rsquo;t drive this guy for crap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s...&rdquo;
Jason pushed sweaty hair out of his face. His eyes flicked between me
and the device. &ldquo;Complicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I twisted my head
to see Lola. She was terrified, her skin gray and waxy. I felt faint
stirrings of an invisible force. And I connected a few data points.
When Lola turned magnetic, that was her heart beating just below the
EMP trigger. It was the weapon preparing to discharge. The first time
it had happened, at Better Future, Lola and I had been getting
intimate. The second time, I had leapt in via her balcony window to
rescue her. At Angelica&rsquo;s, we had kissed: that time she had
actually detonated. And the final data point: she had gone EMP while
driving blind, fleeing from Better Future, and sideswiping a parked
car. Afterward, she&rsquo;d said something like: <em>I thought we hit
a car</em>. Unless that was outlier, she had actually said: <em>I
thought we hit Carl</em>.</p>
<p>If it were me&mdash;well,
if it were me when I was still organic&mdash;my heart rate would peak
at moments of extreme personal danger. But Lola didn&rsquo;t seem to
do that. Her heart seemed to beat fastest when she feared for someone
she cared about, and during moments of intimacy with me.</p>
<p>At times, I had
doubted her. I believed in science: I was skeptical of anything that
couldn&rsquo;t be measured, written down, and independently verified
across a series of double-blind tests. But now I had data. The data
said she loved me so much her heart exploded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lola.&rdquo;
I reached for her, with the arm that still listened. &ldquo;Lola,
kiss me.&rdquo;</p>
