<h5>CHAPTER 
FIVE</h5>
<p>My lab
assistants Kathline and Jason arrived in the Glass Room around eight.
They were holding coffees and talking about something that was
apparently very amusing. They saw me through the green-tinged glass
and froze.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Neumann?</em>
said Kathline. I inferred this from her lip movements. I couldn&rsquo;t
hear her because she hadn&rsquo;t toggled the intercom. I waited for
her to figure this out. &ldquo;Dr. Neumann, what&rsquo;s in the
syringe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morphine.&rdquo; This came out a little muffled because I was
holding my shirt sleeve in my teeth. But I think she understood. I
completed the injection and let my sleeve drop. &ldquo;For the pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the perspex, I saw Kathline and Jason share a glance. Jason
leaned toward the microphone. &ldquo;What pain is that, Dr. Neumann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt disappointed. These two were supposed to be amongst the
brightest of their generation. Yet here I was standing in the Clamp
with a syringe of morphine and they couldn&rsquo;t figure it out. &ldquo;I
think that will become obvious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the wall of the Glass Room was the Big Red Button. If you flipped
up its clear plastic panel and pressed it, everything lost power.
Once, long ago, it had been labeled EMERGENCIES ONLY, but now a
sticker said, DO! NOT!!! PUSH!, because lab assistants are curious.
Jason&rsquo;s eyes flicked toward the button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please call Medical,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To his credit, Jason made it look like he was going for the phone. He
leaned in that direction, even picked up the handset. Then he dropped
it and lunged toward the Big Red Button.</p>
<p>But my button was closer. It was in my hand. The Clamp was
powered-up, humming on standby. Its steel plates were positioned
about&mdash;well, a foot apart. I was sitting on the edge of one. My
right leg, the biological one, dangled between them.</p>
<p>It was just as well I took care of all this in advance, because the
morphine was seeping into my neurons, fogging my synapses. If I
hadn&rsquo;t prepared, Jason might have reached the Big Red Button
before I could activate the Clamp and crush my leg to meat paste. But
I had, and he didn&rsquo;t, and I did.</p>
