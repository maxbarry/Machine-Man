<p>&ldquo;We have a
problem,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
said Lola. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. Pick me up, so you can run real
fast.&rdquo; She held out her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not good on stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The
Contours. They don&rsquo;t handle stairs well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does
that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bug, I
guess. I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to go through the software&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does
that mean for <em>us</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. It means
we can&rsquo;t take the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
talking about stairs?&rdquo; Lola said. &ldquo;Pick me up and let&rsquo;s
jump out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
be able to hold you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you
can.&rdquo; She spread her hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lola, at
12Gs, you&rsquo;ll weigh as much as a small car.&rdquo; She looked a
little insulted, so I added, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not me. That&rsquo;s
physics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can
sneak down an elevator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just heard
the elevator. Between it and us are people who want to kill us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say
kill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Look at
this.&rdquo; I showed her my bicep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. I&rsquo;m
damaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Injured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Injured,&rdquo;
Lola said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re injured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said...&rdquo;
She shook her head. &ldquo;They <em>shot</em> you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would
they do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hesitated. &ldquo;I
kind of killed the CEO.&rdquo; Lola&rsquo;s eyebrows leapt. &ldquo;By
accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are
extenuating circumstances. Trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo;
she said. Outside, I heard approaching footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing
that really irritates me is ten floors down, I have a set of drill
legs just <em>sitting</em> there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you
stomp through the floor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
reinforced concrete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
a no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously
it&rsquo;s a no! It&rsquo;s not going to collapse if it&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
get snippy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I breathed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry. It&rsquo;s just that I strongly believe our lives are in
danger unless we figure a way out of this room in the next ten
seconds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Someone thumped on
the door. Lola and I fell silent. She snaked one hand into mine. I
felt that strange attractive force stir once more, trying to pull my
fingers into her chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get us out
of here, Charlie,&rdquo; Lola whispered.</p>
<p>I decided I would
kick anyone who came through that door. It was not a great plan, and
would probably end badly for some combination of me, Lola, and the
guards outside, but it was all I had. I took a step forward, moving
Lola behind me.</p>
<p>The door banged
open. I tensed. But then I just stood there, my plan already
forgotten, because the person in the doorway was not who I expected.
It was a security guard. I was right about that, at least. It was
Carl.</p>
