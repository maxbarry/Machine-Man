<p>&ldquo;We have a
problem,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
said Lola. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. Pick me up, so you can run real
fast.&rdquo; She held out her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not good on stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The
Contours. They don&rsquo;t handle stairs well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does
that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bug, I
guess. I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to go through the software&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does
that mean for <em>us</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. It means
we can&rsquo;t take the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
talking about stairs?&rdquo; Lola said. &ldquo;Pick me up and let&rsquo;s
jump out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
be able to hold you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you
can.&rdquo; She spread her hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lola, at
12Gs, you&rsquo;ll weigh as much as a small car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
not me. That&rsquo;s physics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can
sneak down an elevator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just heard
the elevator. Between us and it are people who want to kill us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say
kill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Look at
this.&rdquo; I showed her my bicep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. I&rsquo;m
damaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Injured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Injured,&rdquo;
Lola said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re injured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said...&rdquo;
She shook her head. &ldquo;They shot you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would
they do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hesitated. &ldquo;I
kind of killed the CEO. By accident,&rdquo; I added, because Lola&rsquo;s
eyebrows were doing alarming things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are
extenuating circumstances. Trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo;
she said. Outside, I heard approaching footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing
that really irritates me is ten floors down, I have a set of drill
legs just <em>sitting</em> there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you
stomp through the floor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
reinforced concrete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
a no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously
it&rsquo;s a no! It&rsquo;s not going to collapse if it&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
get snippy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I breathed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry. It&rsquo;s just that I strongly believe our lives are in
danger unless we figure a way out of this room in the next ten
seconds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Someone thumped on
the door. Lola and I fell silent. She snaked one hand into mine. I
felt that strange attractive force stir once more, trying to pull my
fingers into her chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get us out
of here, Charlie,&rdquo; Lola whispered.</p>
<p>I decided: I would
kick anyone who came through that door. I took a step forward, moving
Lola behind me. The door banged open, and I tensed. But then I just
stood there, my plan already forgotten, because the person in the
doorway was Carl.</p>
