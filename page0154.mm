<h5>CHAPTER 
THIRTY-TWO</h5>
<p>I said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far we&rsquo;ve
been able to keep the authorities out of this,&rdquo; said Cassandra
Cautery. &ldquo;Although that required calling in a lot of favors,
and we can&rsquo;t keep doing that. I don&rsquo;t want to bore you
with the details, but there are some things you can&rsquo;t ask a
government official to do no matter how much you contribute to their
campaign, and one of those things is ignore a mentally unstable
robot-man wandering around breaking things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. <em>No.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we need
to do is take him down. Then this whole situation, it was just a
little internal product test that didn&rsquo;t go quite right. We
have those. No big deal, no press story, no congressional
investigations. You see? You see how close we are to making this all
okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop. No. I
can&rsquo;t say this strongly enough. I am not going to hunt down
Carl. I am not going to <em>shoot</em> at him.&rdquo; I heard panic in
my voice, because when two people disagree about something obvious,
it means one of them has access to better information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Online,&rdquo;
said one of the men. I felt a distant prickling, like somebody
telling me a story about my childhood. At first I couldn&rsquo;t tell
where it was. Then it grew sharper, and I realized it was in my arm,
the one I didn&rsquo;t have a second ago. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ow,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;<em>Ow</em>.&rdquo; I gripped the metal bicep with my
organic hand, trying to choke off the line of electronic ants I could
feel marching there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
your brain adapting to the nerve signals,&rdquo; said Jason. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll
feel weird for about six days, but then you&rsquo;ll get used to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it
off!&rdquo; At this point I must have gestured, because the gun-arm
swung in an arc and nearly decapitated one of the guys who had
attached it. &ldquo;I want it off!&rdquo; A rapid clicking noise came
from the arm, like a nine-year-old riding a bike with playing cards
stuck in the spokes. I had seen a boy with a bike like that once,
when I was a kid. I thought it was the coolest thing ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s
firing,&rdquo; someone said. Jason said, &ldquo;Dr. Neumann! Please
stop doing that. You&rsquo;ll damage the hammers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want this! You hear me? I&rsquo;m not a super-soldier! I&rsquo;m not
doing this! There is no conceivable situation in which I will do
this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Charlie!</em>&rdquo;
shouted Cassandra Cautery. I jumped, because a woman opening her
throat and letting rip: I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d heard that
before. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to mention this until you were
used to the weapon, because I didn&rsquo;t want you running off after
Carl without knowing what you&rsquo;re doing. But if you won&rsquo;t
listen to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not running after Carl! What is wrong with you? <em>I will not shoot
Carl!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took
Lola.&rdquo; A touch of something like sympathy entered her voice.
&ldquo;Carl took Lola.&rdquo;</p>
