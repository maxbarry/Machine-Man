<h5>CHAPTER 
THIRTY-TWO</h5>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; CC &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; CC &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;No. No. I can&rsquo;t say this too strongly. No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; CC &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not a super-soldier. I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot
express too strongly how very very much I don&rsquo;t want to be a
super-soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&lt;&lt; bit cartoony, this: &gt;&gt;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;Why why...&rdquo; It turned out there was no good way
to say it. &ldquo;Why did you think I&rsquo;d want a gun on my arm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just any
gun,&rdquo; said Jason. &ldquo;This is the Devastator, from Special
Projects. Four hundred rounds per minute, quick-changing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, Jason. <em>I don&rsquo;t want a gun
on my arm</em>.&rdquo; I tried to gesture, and my gun-arm swung
through the air. Everybody stepped back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a
<em>soldier</em>! I&rsquo;m not going to <em>shoot</em> anyone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You settle
down,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re out of
options, Charlie. You think this is what I want? You think that&rsquo;s
my idea of good corporate governance, strap a missile-mounted to a
science guy and send him after a rogue employee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
care!&rdquo; I swung the gun again, for emphasis. &ldquo;This is not
happening! There are no circumstances under which I will do this!&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; CC
explains the gun. Charlie: why the FUCK did you think I&rsquo;d want
a gun in my arm? I&rsquo;m not a fucking soldier! CC: Look, we can&rsquo;t
stop Carl. We&rsquo;re out of options here. Charlie: Maybe I don&rsquo;t
have a beef with Carl. He left me alone, he doesn&rsquo;t want to
kill me, you and Carl sort out your fucking differences. CC: &ldquo;He
took Lola,&rdquo; she said, and everything washed red. &lt;==
Melodramatic, but that kinda thing. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, let
them look at your head,&rdquo; said one of Cautery&rsquo;s
assistants. &ldquo;It could be fractured.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t
find a way to phrase the question that wasn&rsquo;t insane. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> why...&rdquo; The
question felt too big to fit through my brain. &ldquo;Why did you
think I&rsquo;d want a <em>gun on my arm</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
