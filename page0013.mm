<p>My three graduate assistants were
already in the Glass Room: Jason, Kathline, and Elaine. Kathline was
the one who wasn&rsquo;t Chinese. I was supposed to be teaching these
kids something while they worked for me, but I had never been sure
what. They in turn had figured out that I was unlikely to help their
careers, and spent their time making the robot arms perform obscene
gestures and shooting each other with cytoplasms. The only time I
ever saw them look like they were at all interested in what I was
doing, I was lying in Lab 4, tying my shirt around my stump, trying
not to die.</p>
