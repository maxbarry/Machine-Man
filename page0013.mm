<p>My three graduate lab assistants were
already in the Glass Room: Jason, Elaine, and Kathline. Kathline was
the one who wasn&rsquo;t Chinese. I was supposed to be teaching them
something while they worked for me, but I had never been sure what.
They in turn had decided I was unlikely to help their careers, and
spent their time making the robot arms perform obscene gestures and
shooting each other with cytoplasms. I only once saw them look like
they were at all interested in what I was doing, and that was when I
was in Lab 4, tying my shirt around my stump, trying not to die.</p>
