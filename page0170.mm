<p>I thought:
<em>Stockholm Syndrome</em>. That was what they called it, when kidnap
victims came to sympathize with their abductors. It was a
psychological condition. &ldquo;Lola,&rdquo; I said carefully. &ldquo;Just
come here a minute, and we&rsquo;ll talk about me shoot shoot shoot
Carl dead.&rdquo; I bit my lip. Words were bubbling out again. I
wondered where they were coming from, although not really, because I
already knew. &ldquo;I mean...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola rose and began
to walk toward me. We filled with joy, my parts and I, me because
maybe Lola was coming around, and my parts because in a moment they
would get to fill Carl full of holes. Then everything would be fine,
and we would all return to Better Future together. &ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo;
Lola said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
okay. You don&rsquo;t have anything to be sorry about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
my fault.&rdquo; She reached for my face. I felt a flash of
irritation, because she was still blocking me from a clean shot at
Carl. I mean, my parts felt irritated. Or we both did. There was a
certain amount of overlapping going on. &ldquo;I encouraged you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lola, I&rsquo;m
really pleased you&rsquo;re alive, but I&rsquo;m having a little
trouble thinking straight because Carl is there and I have to shoot
him. I have to shoot him. So please move out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola used her hands
to turn my face toward hers. Until this, my eyes had been jumping all
over Carl. Now I really saw her, I was a little shocked by how pale
she looked. &ldquo;Charlie, I&rsquo;m really sorry. But we have to
get rid of your parts.&rdquo;</p>
