<p>I thought:
<em>Stockholm Syndrome</em>. That was what they called it when kidnap
victims came to sympathize with their abductors. It was a
psychological condition. &ldquo;Lola,&rdquo; I said carefully. &ldquo;Just
come here a minute, and we&rsquo;ll talk about me shoot shoot shoot
Carl dead.&rdquo; I bit my lip. Words were bubbling out again. I
wondered where they were coming from, although not really, because I
already knew.</p>
<p>Lola rose and
walked toward me. We filled with joy, my parts and I, me because at
last Lola was acting the way she was supposed to, and my parts
because in a moment they would get to fill Carl full of holes. Then
everything would be fine and we could all return to Better Future
together. &ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo; Lola said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
okay. What? You don&rsquo;t have anything to be sorry about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
kind of my fault.&rdquo; She reached for my face. I felt a flash of
irritation, because she was still blocking me from a shot at Carl. I
mean, my parts felt irritated. Or we both did. There was a certain
amount of overlapping going on. &ldquo;I encouraged you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lola, I&rsquo;m
thrilled you&rsquo;re alive, but I&rsquo;m having a little trouble
thinking straight because Carl is there and I have to shoot him. I
have to shoot him. So please move out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola used her hands
to swivel my face toward hers. Until this, my eyes had been jumping
all over Carl. Now I really saw her, I was a little shocked by how
pale she looked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry, Charlie. But we have
to get rid of your parts.&rdquo;</p>
