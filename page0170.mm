<p>I thought:
<em>Stockholm Syndrome</em>. That was what they called it, when kidnap
victims sympathized with their abductors. It was a psychological
condition. &ldquo;Lola,&rdquo; I said carefully. &ldquo;Just come
here a minute, and we&rsquo;ll talk about me shoot shoot shoot Carl
dead.&rdquo; I bit my lip. Words were bubbling out of me again. <em>Where
are they coming from?</em> I wondered, although I already knew. &ldquo;I
mean...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola rose and
walked toward me. My parts sang with joy. In a moment Lola would move
out of the way, and then we would fill Carl full of holes. Then it
would be done, and we could return to Better Future: me, Lola, and my
parts. We would fix her heart and be happy. &ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
okay. You don&rsquo;t have anything to be sorry about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my
fault.&rdquo; She reached for my face. I felt a flash of irritation,
or my parts did, because she was still blocking me from a clean shot
at Carl. &ldquo;I encouraged you. I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lola,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really pleased you&rsquo;re alive and
everything, but I&rsquo;m having a little trouble thinking right now
because Carl is there and I have to shoot him. I really have to shoot
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola turned my face
toward her. Until this, my eyes had been jumping all over Carl. I was
a little shocked by how pale she was. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry,
Charlie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But you have to get rid of the
parts.&rdquo;</p>
