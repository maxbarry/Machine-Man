<p>I went for the Contours, half-expecting
Carl to stop me. I had, after all, used these to flee the company; I
would have understood if Carl&rsquo;s hand had closed on my wrist and
he said: <em>Choose something slower</em>.
But he just leaned against one wall with his massive arms folded
while I lifted myself onto the table and began pulling them on.</p>
<p>I
won&rsquo;t lie. It was possibly the most sensual experience of my
life. I had missed the legs, terribly, but still underestimated how
it would feel to have them back. As I slid my __ terminated thighs
into the restraints, and began aligning the tiny needles that would
transmit my nerve signals to circuitry, I heard a high wind blowing
through my mind. The wind said: <em>You&rsquo;re back.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Those legs
can press, what? A ton?&rdquo; said Carl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something
like that.&rdquo; It was four tonnes. And, frankly, that was nothing,
compared to some of the others. But I resisted saying that, because I
felt Carl was trying to engage me here, and I did not want to be
engaged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can
never be strong enough,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for
sure.&rdquo;</p>
