<p>One time in
college, I tried to buy a pack of Doritos from a vending machine. I
fed my bills into the slot, pressed C (firmly) then 4 (firmly), and
waited. Nothing happened, so I pressed C-4 again (more firmly). Still
nothing. I tried CANCEL, thinking to start over, and the machine
whirred, the steel coil revolved, and the Doritos packet edged
closer, then stuck there.</p>
<p>I cursed and kicked
it, because I was 22 and there were people watching, and said, &ldquo;This
<em>stupid</em> machine.&rdquo; &lt;&lt; It was humiliating to be
defeated by an inanimate object, especially one designed to do what I
wanted. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; But then
&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;As I stared at the dangling Doritos packet, &gt;&gt;
a different way of looking at the situation occurred to me. In this
scenario, the vending machine was intelligent and I was a machine.
The vending machine, for reasons of its own&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think
it&rsquo;s important to know the vending machine&rsquo;s motivation,
but say it was bored&mdash;poked my buttons in order to elicit
particular behaviors. This scenario made sense because if you
replaced me with a different human being they would have acted the
same way. There was nothing unique or unpredictable about me getting
mad; an intelligent vending machine would know that&rsquo;s what
humans do when you dangle snacks in front of them.</p>
<p><A NAME="firstHeading1"></A>I
spent the rest of the day trying to think why an objective observor
should believe I was controlling the vending machine in this
situation and not the other way around. And I couldn&rsquo;t. I had a
brain and the vending machine didn&rsquo;t, but that was classic
anthropocentrism: for all I
knew, the vending machine&rsquo;s consciousness resided in a space I
didn&rsquo;t understand. It might argue I couldn&rsquo;t have
consciousness because I didn&rsquo;t have a coin slot. 
</p>
<p>That was when I
decided there wasn&rsquo;t much difference between humans and
machines. We&rsquo;re more complex, of course, but it&rsquo;s a
distinction of degrees, not difference. We&rsquo;re all vending
machines.</p>
