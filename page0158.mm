<p>One time in
university, I failed to buy a pack of Doritos from a hallway vending
machine. I fed my bills into the slot, pressed C and 4, and nothing
happened. So I pressed the buttons again, with more authority, then
CANCEL, then as many buttons as I could at the same time. I cursed
and slapped it, because I was 19 and there were people watching, and
said, &ldquo;Stupid machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hours later, I was
passing by on my way to class and another guy was there, staring at
it. I opened my mouth to tell him it was busted, but he glanced at me
and slapped its side, right where I had, muttering, &ldquo;Stupid
machine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt shaken. I
guess it&rsquo;s always uncomfortable to discover you are not quite
as individual as you thought. What bothered me, though, wasn&rsquo;t
my similarity to this guy, but to the vending machine. I began to
wonder why I should be considered the independent entity in this
situation, exerting my free will to elicit predictable, mechanical
reactions from the vending machine, and not the other way around. A
truly objective observor, I suspected, would find it equally likely
that the vending machine was choosing to withhold snacks in order to
extract mechanical responses (a slap, a curse) from complex but
fundamentally predictable humans.</p>
<p>Once, during a
floor party, I tried to raise this with a Philosophy major. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
a determinist.&rdquo; Her tone implied this was kind of cute, like
believing in the Tooth Fairy. &ldquo;Shock. A determinist science
geek.&rdquo; We argued about free will for a while, which was
frustrating because people from Humanities only want to play word
games, then she went to make out with a guy I didn&rsquo;t know. I
left the party and went down to the vending machine. I sat on the
floor in front of it, watching. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I hoped to
see. I just felt we had a lot in common.</p>
