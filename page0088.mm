<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
get me wrong,&rdquo; said the Manager. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to
denigrate your contribution.&rdquo; He smiled. I did not feel
reassured. I felt locked up. My brain was trying to remodel the last
two months in order to fit new input: <em>these in-house test
subjects... we&rsquo;ve already begun</em>. It was drawing resources
away from other functions. I was hanging. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d be a
fool to ignore the commercial possibilities. And I hope I&rsquo;m not
a fool.&rdquo; He smiled again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing
is, Charlie, they&rsquo;re not really your parts,&rdquo; said
Cassandra Cautery. She was somewhere behind me. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
the company&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Manager
chuckled. &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s talking about taking away your
parts.&rdquo; His eyes moved at Cassandra Cautery, and she closed her
mouth with an audible click. &ldquo;As long as Dr. Neumann remains a
valuable member of Better Future, he can have all the parts he
wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.
That&rsquo;s what I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Cassie
means is that the time when you were this company&rsquo;s only
design-capable employee, we see that as having passed. That&rsquo;s a
credit to you, by the way. You should be proud of the way your people
have picked up your skills and knowledge. It means we can move you
into an area even better suited to your unique skills and
experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My
brain said: <em>Lola has an Augmentation</em>.
That was all it had so far. It was still trying to reconcile this
with the fact that she hadn&rsquo;t told me about it. Did Lola not
trust me? How could she talk to the company and not me?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our first
test subjects... well, they experienced some issues,&rdquo; said the
Manager. &ldquo;Stresses. Psychotic breaks. That kind of thing. It
was a surprise, since you didn&rsquo;t demonstrate any such symptoms.
It got us thinking about the psychology. We decided that you, Dr.
Neumann, would be absolutely perfect at guiding these people through
the process. Teaching them that life really is better with an
Augmentation. I mean, look at you! You&rsquo;re inspiring. I
sincerely believe you could uplift and inspire our test subjects
about life with an Augmentation.&rdquo; Behind him, the sun moved
behind a cloud. &ldquo;Especially those who don&rsquo;t know they
have one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because the logical
part of my brain was occupied, it did nothing to stop the raw,
instinctive jolt of hostility that burst through my body. That&rsquo;s
my explanation, anyway. My Contours twitched, and I kicked the
Manager through the window.</p>
