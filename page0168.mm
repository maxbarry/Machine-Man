<p>Something was
burning. I looked down at my shoulder and saw the bandages there
smoking. It said something that I smelt this rather than felt it: it
said I was still enjoying Better Future&rsquo;s industrial-grade
drugs. <em>Is he dead?</em> my parts asked, and I said: <em>I don&rsquo;t
know</em>. We lowered the gun-arm and walked toward the garage. As the
concrete dust began to dissipate, the extent of the damage we had
wreaked became visible: it looked gnawed by giant rats. So much of it
had slid into the alley that the Contours could walk on a shifting
hill of rubble and broken concrete slabs almost all the way up the
level from which we had fallen. Sometimes chunks cracked and fell
away beneath our hooves, but I was not concerned. My parts knew what
they were doing.</p>
<p>Sirens, distant but
rising.</p>
<p>We climbed the last
section and entered the ruined garage. It was dark, so we stood there
a moment, listening. Then I heard his breathing. It sounded
spasmodic, rattling, the breathing of a man trying hard to not die. <em>I
think we got him</em>, I told the parts, and they said: <em>Let&rsquo;s
make sure.</em></p>
<p>We moved through
clouds of dust. &ldquo;Carl?&rdquo; We stopped, my bearings
momentarily lost. &ldquo;Where are you, Carl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I saw his legs
poking out from behind the elevator block. We circled around, keeping
our distance, because there were to be no last-minute tricks from
Carl. He would not brain us with a chunk of concrete as we rushed
around the corner. He would not open one metal hand to reveal any
kind of explosive device he had swiped from Better Future. The way
this was going to work was we would maintain a safe distance from
Carl at all times. We would tell him a few things about Lola. And we
would shoot him.</p>
<p>We stepped around a
concrete pillar. Carl didn&rsquo;t look right. It was just like the
moment I&rsquo;d first spotted him in this parking garage: he was
there, but I couldn&rsquo;t figure out his posture. <em>Shoot</em>,
said the parts, <em>Now. Shoot</em>, and the gun-arm whirred like a
suggestion.</p>
<p>The section of
Carl&rsquo;s body that didn&rsquo;t make sense turned. It was Lola.
She was kneeling beside him. She seemed to be crying. &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Please, Charlie, stop.&rdquo;</p>
