<p>Carl opened the limo door and I emerged into bright sunshine to two
dozen Better Future employees lining the path to the lobby. When they
saw me, they began to clap. Carl lifted me into a gleaming
wheelchair; there were cheers. As Carl pushed me past the crowd, some
put out hands for high-fives. I saw a woman from Human Resources who
had never made eye contact with me before, ever, and as I passed she
whispered, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an inspiration.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t
understand what was happening.</p>
<p>Inside the lobby, Cassandra Cautery was waiting with folded arms and
gleaming eyes. &ldquo;Welcome back.&rdquo; Her voice was choked with
emotion, as if I were her son returned from war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>She stayed alongside as Carl steered me through security. The steel
wheelchair didn&rsquo;t set off any alarms, which was interesting. Or
maybe they did, but the guards were under instruction to ignore it.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken the liberty of expanding your staff. What do
you think of that Jason Huong? I left him, in case he&rsquo;s a
favorite, but really, his metrics are average.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jason&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put a hand on my shoulder. Carl took the hint and stopped
pushing. Cassandra Cautery looked deep into my eyes. She was so
short, we were almost level. &ldquo;It would be no problem to get rid
of him. Permanently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jason&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery nodded. She was still holding my shoulder. &ldquo;I
just don&rsquo;t want anything to get in your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the way of building prosthetic legs.&rdquo; I felt it was
important to clarify.</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery&rsquo;s hand tightened on my shoulder. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Or furthering your project in any way that makes
sense to your beautiful, brilliant mind.&rdquo;</p>
