<p>spent my days
surrounded by the Contours&rsquo; dismembered corpse, and 
</p>
<p>was too much to
apologize to their murderer</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; I think
Charlie needs to decide the Contours are a hopeless case <em>before</em>
Lola gets him the arc welder. It&rsquo;s useless, doesn&rsquo;t solve
his problem, but it&rsquo;s a really nice gesture. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Charlie
and Lola make up in a weird way. Each leaving something out for the
other. Finally Lola leaves out an arc welder. What does Charlie do
for Lola? &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>They communicated
telepathically. &lt;&lt; end with the dogs all lined up, watching &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>Apparently
depression is good for problem-solving. It&rsquo;s the evolutionary
reason for it: to get you focussing obsessively on your problems
until you figure out a solution. You become more analytical,
critical. You don&rsquo;t eat. Your brain ticks over and over,
reworking your problem from all angles.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s
essentially what depression is: obsessive focus on your problems. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>analytical thinking</p>
<p></p>
<p> reallocation of
resources to the parts of brain that are good at figuring things out.
You obsess on your problems

<p>On the eighth day,
Lola brought me an arc welder.

<p>Maybe one more

<p>I came to see
Angelica&rsquo;s dogs as a hive mind. They were many, but one. They
communicated via telepathy. If I yelled at one in the bathroom, I
would emerge to find three more, trembling on the carpet with shared
outrage. Taken as individuals, they were some of the stupidest
mammals I had ever encountered. When I walked toward one, more often
than not it would freeze, wanting to flee but unable to figure out if
I would maintain my current trajectory or maybe start teleporting
around the room. As a collective, though, the dogs were plotting
something. I was sure of it. They wanted me out of the house and were
beginning to figure out methods. Any time I entered a room to
multiple sets of glittering eyes, I got nervous.</p>

<p></p>
<p><em>You could have calmed down</em>,
said a part of my brain. This was unfair, of course, which is why I
didn&rsquo;t say it. But it was a fair point. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I picked up a
curved piece of titanium. The problem with this, like most of the
pieces around me, was it was machine-welded. I couldn&rsquo;t get
inside. There were real technical limits here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just want
to know what I should do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get me an
arc welder,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;A big one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola was silent. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,
Charlie,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;Tell me what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me a
torque wrench. And a soldering iron. And transistors. Lots of
transistors.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; I think
Charlie doesn&rsquo;t really believe he can fix this. He&rsquo;s
despondent. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;I just want
to know how I can help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Some time
passes here, I think. A few weeks, as Charlie rebuilds himself. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Rebuilding
brings Charlie closer to his legs. He&rsquo;s hands-on. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Lola comes
in and finds him sitting there with all his parts scattered around.
Charlie sends her out for stuff. She&rsquo;s worried about him.
Charlie versus the dogs. Hive mind. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; This is
nice. Another step in the descent into madness. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; I think as
he goes crazy, he&rsquo;s aware that he&rsquo;s doing it. He&rsquo;s
not unaware of his own insanity. He just feels like he has to get
this done and then he&rsquo;ll fix all the social stuff. In the
meantime he&rsquo;s really determined. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Hard for
him to work with only one hand. He should probably fix the hand
first. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Charlie
should start running conversations in his head with his hand. He
knows it&rsquo;s not real, but he finds it helpful. Like that
cardboard cutout dog. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Charlie
would want to sedate himself into unconsciousness. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Maybe
Charlie wants to be alone. Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t want them to take
him out of his legs. Maybe he won&rsquo;t let them come into his
room. He needs to grieve. What are the stages of grief? 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;RW this for
Charlie fighting dogs to rebuild legs.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I came to see

multiple sets of glittering eyes, I got nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re
so silly,&rdquo; said Lola, scratching a tiny brown head. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
gorgeous. Aren&rsquo;t you, baby? Yes, you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They hate
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try being
nicer to them.&rdquo; The dog began licking Lola&rsquo;s neck. She
shrieked and tried to push it away, but not very effectively. &ldquo;Stop
that! Bad puppy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I noticed another
dog sitting on the arm of the sofa. It was staring at me, despite the
play-fight going on right in front of it. I got the feeling this dog
was sending me a message. Something like: <em>We have your girlfriend</em>.</p>
<p>My legs stepped
forward. The dog leaped off the sofa and scampered away. I smiled
despite myself. <em>Stop that</em>, I said. <em>Bad legs</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; soft
sciences: Charlie asks Lola about id. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Id comprises the unorganised
part of the personality structure that contains the basic drives. It
acts according to the pleasure principle, seeking to avoid pain or
unpleasure. </em>
