<p>Something blew
through me in a gust, like wind made of needles. My legs twitched. My
ears rang. And that was it. The house was silent. I looked at Lola
and she looked at me and we both seemed to be okay. Lola said, &ldquo;Are
you...&rdquo; and so did I. She took a step toward me, and, when
nothing bad happened, took another. We smiled. I held out my arms and
she ran into them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Charlie.
I was scared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
all right. We&rsquo;re all right, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something
that didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo; I kissed the top of her head. &ldquo;I
guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought
you were going to die.&rdquo; She shuddered. &ldquo;I thought I was
going to kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment passed.
There was an odd scent in the air: something acrid.</p>
<p>Lola looked up.
&ldquo;The dogs are quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should
check on Angelica.&rdquo; Lola reached for the door handle. I went to
step out of the way, but didn&rsquo;t. I tried that again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That scent was
familiar. It was the smell you got when you plugged a circuit into a
power supply it wasn&rsquo;t designed for. The smell of fused
transistors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A digital clock
radio sat on the bedside table: its face had gone dark. On a shelf, a
small stereo that normally glowed red from its power button: nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you two
okay?&rdquo; Angelica&rsquo;s voice floated toward us. &ldquo;The
power&rsquo;s gone out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola touched my
arm. &ldquo;Charlie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;No, no, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I opened my mouth
and closed it again. I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to say it: <em>You
killed my legs</em>.</p>
