<h5>CHAPTER 
TWENTY-THREE</h5>
<p>I woke happy. It
was dark. I didn&rsquo;t know where I was. But I had come from a
wonderful dream, in which I held hands with Lola, and she smiled, and
we were safe. I lay still in the bed, bathing in bliss, because we
were surely not terribly far from making this a reality. We had a few
complications, sure, like being pursued by a Better Future security
guard with multifunction sledgehammer arms. But that didn&rsquo;t
seem terribly significant compared to the miracle that was Lola
saying, <em>I love him</em>. With that, everything else was solvable.</p>
<p>I sat up. I was in
a small bedroom. On the wall hung posters of what I think may have
been a soccer player. Small shoes lay jumbled in a basket. I was in a
kid&rsquo;s room. In fact, now I looked properly, this bed I was in
seemed awfully small. It was five feet long at most. Which meant&mdash;</p>
<p>I froze. I was not
wearing my legs.</p>
<p>The pain hit like a
locomotive. My toes bent, my legs burned with tight white fire, my
feet curled, and the fact that none of this was real made it any
better. I yelped and threw back the covers, tried to massage the
space where my legs were be, but I knew it would be no good without
the Contours and was right. Tears streamed down my face. <em>The
painkillers have worn off</em>, my brain whispered. <em>You&rsquo;re on
your own now</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My legs!&rdquo;
I screamed. &ldquo;Somebody get me my legs!&rdquo;</p>
