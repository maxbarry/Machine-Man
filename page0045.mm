<p>I was left alone in
the medical room. It was just me, a bed, and a vinyl floor with some
alarming stains. To be honest, I was surprised about the state of
this room. Compared to the rest of the company, it was third world. I
guess it said something about our priorities. We were not healers.</p>
<p>The door was
locked. At least, I assumed it was. I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to
drag my body off the bed and across the floor to check. I was missing
my legs. I was <em>missing</em> my legs. I felt wrong without them. It
was a terrible injustice, that people could take them away from me.
Sitting in that room, half a man, I vowed to never let anyone do that
again.</p>
