<p>The funny thing
about running with Lola was I nearly dropped her. Well, not funny.
Dropping Lola while trying to escape a dimly-lit subterranean parking
from Better Future security personnel, that would not have been
funny. After all the effort to get this far, that would have been
incredibly frustrating. Also possibly fatal. But what I mean is I
didn&rsquo;t realize how I&rsquo;d already gotten used to the
Contours&mdash;how to lean with them as they moved, how a tiny click
near the hip meant they were about to jag&mdash;until I tried to do
it with a hundred ten-pound woman in my arms.</p>
<p>The Contours bolted
out of the elevator and Lola slipped around my side. She yelped; her
fingers clawed at my back. I managed to pull her back when the
Contours sidestepped a guard I hadn&rsquo;t even seen and Lola
slipped right out of my grasp. She kept hold of me: she locked her
legs around my waist, and, as she slid around behind me, wrapped her
arms around my neck. I choked. My eyes watered. I had no idea what
the hell was going on. Then we burst into sunlight and Lola bounced
around to my front again and the top of her skull popped me right in
the nose. As we hit the road, we clung to each other like lovers,
lovers who were very angry with each other. I closed my eyes and
willed the Contours to take us somewhere safe.</p>
