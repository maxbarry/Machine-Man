<p>I sat on the edge
of the bath, wrapped in a towel. When Lola came back, it was like the
day we&rsquo;d met, because she was carrying prosthetic legs. She set
them down, watching my face. &ldquo;Now, these are nothing
special...&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were
entry-level models: crutch-like poles, with plastic buckets for my
thighs. The kind of prosthetics you saw on Vietnam veterans who had
been abandoned by their government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were
all Angelica could swipe,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;I know they&rsquo;re
basic, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re
perfect,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola beamed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
proud of you, Charlie.&rdquo; She wrapped her arms around me and
squeezed. &ldquo;Want to try them on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The straps were
ragged, dark in patches. A lot of amputated thighs must have sweated
into these prosthetics before mine. The sockets were loose in some
places and pinched tight in others. I couldn&rsquo;t just sit in
them, like the Contours: I had to walk, as if they were stilts. They
<em>were</em> stilts. My first step, with one arm slung over Lola&rsquo;s
shoulder, I accidentally kicked the wall and left a mark. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
okay,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;Keep trying.&rdquo; The scar tissue of
my thighs wailed in outrage: it hadn&rsquo;t had to bear pressure
before. It was tender from all those jabs from the Contours&rsquo;
nerve interface needles. Within four steps, I had to look down, to
check if the sockets were filling with blood. Sweat popped out around
my hairline and ran down my nose.</p>
<p>I made it to the
door, and Lola helped lower me to the toilet seat. &ldquo;That was
great, Charlie. That was a really good first effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>She reached for a
buckle. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine for now. At first, you take it slow.
One day at a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; I
panted. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the spirit, Charlie!&rdquo; She squeezed my trembling thigh. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the spirit!&rdquo;</p>
