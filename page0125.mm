<p>I sat on the edge
of the bath, wrapped in a towel. When Lola came back, it was like the
day we&rsquo;d met, because she was carrying prosthetic legs. She set
them down, watching my face. &ldquo;Now, these are nothing
special...&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were
entry-level models: crutch-like poles, with plastic buckets for my
thighs. They were the kind of prosthetics you saw on Vietnam veterans
who had been abandoned by their government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were
all Angelica could swipe,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;I know they&rsquo;re
basic, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re
perfect,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola wrapped her
arms around me and squeezed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you, Charlie.&rdquo;
She straightened, and looked very happy. &ldquo;Want to try them on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The straps were
ragged, dark in patches. A lot of amputated thighs must have sweated
into these prosthetics before mine. The sockets were loose in some
places and pinched tight in others. I couldn&rsquo;t just sit in
them, like the Contours: I had to walk, as if they were stilts. They
<em>were</em> stilts. My first step, with one arm slung over Lola&rsquo;s
shoulder, I accidentally kicked the wall and left a mark. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
okay,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;Keep trying.&rdquo; The scar tissue of
my thighs screamed in outrage: it had never had to bear pressure. It
was tender from all those jabs from the Contours&rsquo; nerve
interface needles. Within four steps, I felt like they it was
splitting open. I looked down, to check whether the sockets were
filling with blood. Sweat popped out around my hairline and ran down
my nose.</p>
<p>Four steps later,
Lola helped lower me to the toilet seat. &ldquo;That was great,
Charlie. That was a really good first effort.&rdquo; She reached for
a buckle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take them off. Early days, you take it
slow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; I
panted, trying to catch my breath. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face lit up.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit, Charlie!&rdquo; She grinned, kissed
my cheek. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit!&rdquo;</p>
