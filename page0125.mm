<p>I sat on the edge
of the bath, wrapped in a towel. When Lola came back, it was like the
day we&rsquo;d met, because she was carrying prosthetic legs. She set
them down, watching my face. &ldquo;Now, these are nothing
special...&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had
crutch-like poles and plastic buckets for my thighs. They were
entry-level. They were prosthetics for Vietnam veterans abandoned by
their government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were
all Angelica could swipe,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;I know they&rsquo;re
basic, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re
perfect,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola beamed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
proud of you, Charlie.&rdquo; She squeezed my naked shoulder. &ldquo;Want
to try them on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The straps were
ragged and worn, dark in patches. A lot of amputated thighs had sweat
into these prosthetics before mine. The sockets were loose in some
places and pinched tight in others. I couldn&rsquo;t sit in them,
like the Contours: I had to walk, as if they were stilts. They <em>were</em>
stilts. My first step, with one arm slung over Lola&rsquo;s shoulder,
I accidentally kicked the wall, leaving a long mark. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
okay,&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;Keep trying.&rdquo; The scar tissue of
my thighs wailed: it hadn&rsquo;t borne pressure before. It was
tender from all those jabs from the Contours&rsquo; nerve interface
needles. Within four steps, I was sure the sockets were filling with
blood. Sweat popped out around my hairline and ran down my nose.</p>
<p>We made it to the
door. Lola helped lower me to the toilet seat. &ldquo;That was great,
Charlie. That was a really good first effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I managed: &ldquo;Ha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reached for a
buckle. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough for now. At first, you take it
slow. It was a really good&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
go again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyebrows
jumped. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit, Charlie!&rdquo; She was
delighted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit!&rdquo;</p>
