<p>&ldquo;Well that
doesn&rsquo;t sound too bad,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo;
said Lola. &ldquo;Look at me. Tell me you&rsquo;re in control of your
body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in
total control.&rdquo; My parts tried to add, <em>Kill Carl</em>, but I
stopped them. That would have undermined us. My statement was not
true, of course; it had become clear that I wasn&rsquo;t in charge of
this body so much as cohabiting with it. And that aside, at least
some of me could be turned on or off at a distance by Better Future.
I was in total control of very little. But I had to object to
something, because Lola had opened this line of conversation with: <em>We
have to get rid of your parts</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over time,&rdquo;
said Lola, &ldquo;we can re-train your brain. Your neurons will move
elsewhere, if we give them the right tasks. Once we replace these
parts with standard prosthetics&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me stop
you there.&rdquo; I worked very hard to keep my voice from shaking.
&ldquo;Because I know you probably have my best interests in mind,
Lola, but I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;re really appreciating the
fact that, at this point, I am essentially <em>a head</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no
<em>getting rid of the parts</em>. I <em>am</em> the parts. I will die
without the parts. And yes, okay, there is a certain amount of
psychological adjustment going on</p>

<p>Outside the parking
garage, the sirens grew louder. There would be flashing blue lights
soon, and demands over megaphones.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Charlie
was nobody before. Not confident. Nobody. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Charlie
scathing about <em>id</em>. That&rsquo;s a soft science! &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; Carl&rsquo;s
story &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p><U>Shocks:</U></p>
<p>1. &lt;&lt; &ldquo;He
didn&rsquo;t kidnap me. He rescued me.&rdquo; (Carl) &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>2. &lt;&lt; &ldquo;You
have to get rid of the parts.&rdquo; &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>3. &lt;&lt; &ldquo;The
parts are you.&rdquo; (Neurons.) &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>4. &lt;&lt; &ldquo;I
had forgotten about the microphone.&rdquo; (BF is listening, en
route.) &gt;&gt;</p>
