<p>&ldquo;Well that
doesn&rsquo;t sound too bad,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo;
said Lola. &ldquo;Look at me. Tell me you&rsquo;re in control of your
body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in
total control.&rdquo; My parts tried to add, <em>Kill Carl</em>, but I
stopped them. That would have undermined our point. Which was a lie,
of course; I wasn&rsquo;t in charge of this body so much as
cohabiting with it. Plus, at least some of me could be turned on or
off at a distance by Better Future. I was in total control of very
little. But I had to object to something, because Lola had opened
this line of conversation with: <em>We have to get rid of your parts</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over time,&rdquo;
said Lola, &ldquo;we can re-train your brain. With the right physical
therapy, your neurons will move elsewhere. If we replace these parts
with standard prosthetics&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me stop
you there.&rdquo; I tried to keep my voice from shaking, but it
didn&rsquo;t work. &ldquo;I know you have my best interests in mind,
Lola, but I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;re really appreciating the
fact that at this point I am essentially <em>a head</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no
<em>getting rid of the parts</em>. I <em>am</em> the parts. Look at me.
You think this little fleshy bit at the top can survive on its own
any more? No. I passed that point. And I sawed my own arm off, Lola,
I <em>sawed it off</em>, and that can&rsquo;t be for nothing. It can&rsquo;t.
So let&rsquo;s... let&rsquo;s all calm down and forget about crazy
solutions that involve things that can never happen.&rdquo; I went to
wipe the sweat from my brow with my gun-arm and nearly knocked my
head off. I tried that again. I was trembling, and not just in my
biology: it felt as if it were coming from deep within my parts. Only
they were not nervous. They were angry. Or <em>I</em> was, by Lola&rsquo;s
theory: my subconscious was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The id is
the part of you devoted to raw impulses. It&rsquo;s not supposed to
be in charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <em>id</em>,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;This is psychology! A soft science!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You changed.
You used to be quiet. Thoughtful. Now you walk around with a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s
nothing wrong with the gun. Don&rsquo;t insult the gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not the person you used to be. You haven&rsquo;t only changed your
body. You&rsquo;ve changed <em>you</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Changed.
Improved.&rdquo; Words spilled out of me, tripping over each other.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you realize, Lola, but the person I used
to be, nobody liked him. Nobody. I didn&rsquo;t date. I didn&rsquo;t
talk to people. I worked. But when I started doing this, people paid
attention. People got interested. People like you. So maybe I have
changed, maybe there has been a little personality rewiring here, but
is that such a bad thing? Isn&rsquo;t that just self-improvement?
Because I think I&rsquo;m better now, Lola. I do. Yes, I&rsquo;m a
little jittery, and the parts are talking all the time now, but
that&rsquo;s okay. I can live with that. Nothing works perfectly the
first time. The point is, on balance, isn&rsquo;t this a step
forward?&rdquo; I could see from Lola&rsquo;s expression that this
argument was not having much effect. &ldquo;Forget that. The fact is,
I have parts. That&rsquo;s who I am. And even if I could survive on
some kind of shitty life support system in a hospital room somewhere,
<em>I don&rsquo;t want to</em>. Do you know what this body can do? We
have inbuilt GPS, Lola. What are we supposed to do, go back to <em>maps</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The parts
and...&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t finish this sentence. It would have been
pointless. <em>Shoot</em>, said the parts; they had been saying this a
while, increasingly insistent, like a drumbeat. My eyes moved to
Carl. He was the source of all this trouble. He had been messing with
me since day one. Shooting him would solve everything, or maybe not,
maybe the logic wasn&rsquo;t quite there, but the part of me that was
screaming to shoot him didn&rsquo;t care about that. It just wanted
him dead. And Lola: Lola would understand. Maybe not right away. But
eventually. She would come around. Because let&rsquo;s not kid
ourselves, Lola wasn&rsquo;t going to stick around for a <em>head</em>.
She would want a man, i.e. someone who could stand up. It was best
for everyone if I just shot Carl shot him shot him dead.</p>
<p>I pushed Lola
aside. It was as easy as brushing through a curtain. And as I walked
up to Carl, raising the gun-arm, my body flooded with joy, and I felt
in my heart, wherever that was, that I was doing the right thing.</p>
