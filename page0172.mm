<p>&ldquo;Well that
doesn&rsquo;t sound too bad,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie.&rdquo;
There was pain in her voice. &ldquo;Look at me. Tell me you&rsquo;re
in control of your body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in
total control.&rdquo; My parts tried to add: <em>Kill Carl</em>, but I
stopped them. Or stopped myself, if what Lola said about free-roaming
neurons in the subconscious was true. I wasn&rsquo;t sure about that
theory. It sounded plausible. It sounded a lot more plausible than
the idea of my titanium parts spontaneously developing consciousness
on their own. But it did not feel plausible. Because that would mean
that there was no other entity here: that I was alone in this body,
talking to myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over time,
Charlie, we can re-train your brain. With the right physical therapy,
your neurons will move elsewhere. We can replace these parts with
more standard prosthetics that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me stop
you there.&rdquo; I tried to keep my voice from shaking. &ldquo;I
know you have my best interests in mind, Lola, but I&rsquo;m not sure
you really appreciate the fact that at this point I am essentially a
<em>head</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no
<em>getting rid of the parts</em>. I <em>am</em> the parts. Look at me.
You think this little fleshy bit at the top can survive on its own
any more? No. I passed that point. And I sawed my own arm off, Lola,
I <em>sawed it off</em>, and that can&rsquo;t be for nothing. It can&rsquo;t.
So let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s calm down, and forget about crazy
solutions that involve things that can never happen.&rdquo; I went to
wipe the sweat from my brow with my gun-arm and nearly knocked my
head off. I tried that again. I was trembling, and not just in my
biology: it was coming from deep within my parts. They were angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The id is
the part of your mind devoted to raw impulses. It&rsquo;s not
supposed to be in charge. You&rsquo;ll feel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <em>id</em>.
This is psychology! A soft science!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You
changed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You used to be thoughtful. Now you
walk around with a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s
nothing wrong with the gun. Don&rsquo;t insult the gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t
just change your body. You&rsquo;ve changed <em>you</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Changed.
Improved.&rdquo; Words spilled out of me, tripping over each other.
&ldquo;The thing is, Lola, the person I used to be, nobody liked him.
I didn&rsquo;t date. I didn&rsquo;t talk to people. I worked. But
when I started doing this, people paid attention. People got
interested. People like you. So maybe I have changed, maybe there has
been a little personality rewiring here, but is that such a bad
thing? Isn&rsquo;t that just self-improvement? Because I think I&rsquo;m
better now, Lola. I do. Yes, I&rsquo;m a little jittery, and the
parts are talking all the time, but that&rsquo;s okay. I can live
with that. To be honest, it&rsquo;s not that bad to have a little
company for once. And nothing works perfectly the first time. You
don&rsquo;t scrap the whole project every time there&rsquo;s a hitch.
You keep what you&rsquo;ve got and look for iterative improvement.
The point is, on balance, isn&rsquo;t this a step forward?&rdquo; I
could see from Lola&rsquo;s expression that none of this was very
persuasive. &ldquo;Okay, forget that. The fact is, I need the parts.
To live. There&rsquo;s nothing I can do. My hands are tied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lola&rsquo;s mouth
opened. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>I don&rsquo;t
care!</em> Even if I could survive on some kind of shitty life support
system in a hospital room somewhere, <em>I don&rsquo;t want to!</em> Do
you know what this body can do? We have&mdash;we have inbuilt GPS,
Lola! What are we supposed to do, go back to <em>maps</em>?&rdquo; I
forced myself to calm. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just an example. Because
what you&rsquo;re talking about, Lola, it&rsquo;s like asking me to
move out of my apartment and go live in a cave. A cave in the
<em>jungle</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
&lsquo;we?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The parts
and...&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t finish this sentence. I had realized it
was pointless. <em>Shoot</em>, said the parts; they had been saying
this a while, increasingly insistent. My eyes moved to Carl. He was
the source of this trouble. He had been since day one. Shooting him
would solve everything, or maybe not, maybe the logic of that wasn&rsquo;t
quite there, but the part of me that wanted to shoot didn&rsquo;t
care so much about that. It just wanted him dead. And Lola: Lola
would understand. Maybe not right away. But eventually. She would
come around. Because let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves, Lola wasn&rsquo;t
going to stick around for a head. I didn&rsquo;t care what she
thought now, that was not a recipe for a successful long-term
relationship. It was best for everyone if I shot Carl now shot him
shot him dead.</p>
<p>I brushed Lola
aside. It was as easy as walking through a curtain. As I walked up to
Carl, raising the gun-arm, my body flooded with joy, and I felt in my
heart, wherever that was, that I was doing the right thing.</p>
