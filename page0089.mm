<h5>CHAPTER 
NINETEEN</h5>

<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I wanted to say:
<em>What area?</em> But my mouth wouldn&rsquo;t move. My brain was
still processing.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>the raw,
instinctive jolt of hostility</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>He stepped toward
me again, and I guess I was in a heightened state of anxiety, because
my brain barked THREAT, and my Contours twitched, and I kicked him
through the window.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I did next was
determined by the raw, instinctive jolt of hostility</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I made a decision

<p></p>
<p>I made a decision
with 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We came to believe
that it was better to install 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Even in the glare,
I could see strain on her face. &ldquo;Nobody knows what an
Augmentation is like better than you, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>your primary
usefulness is no longer in design. Thanks to your tutelage, we have a
half-dozen people who can do design. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>that there are now
a half-dozen people in this organization who, under your tutelage,
have gained the necessary expertise to design Better Future Combat
Augmentations. Again, that&rsquo;s not to underplay your
significance. It&rsquo;s my fervent hope that you will tell me right
now that you want to continue to lead the team down this exciting
road. But if you don&rsquo;t...&rdquo; He shrugged. &ldquo;Well, we
can do this without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You no longer have
to be the only guy. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>, we see that as
having passed. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>confined to
open-ended, experimental research, we see that as having passed.
Because 
</p>
<p>Your usefulness
today, Dr. Neumann, is in passing on that knowledge to your peers</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>we see the time
when your sole role was experimenting 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>you have useful
skills</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a
range of useful duties you can perform for us,&rdquo; said the
Manager. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>He paused, in case
I wanted to say something. But I was still busy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This project exists
because of you. I&rsquo;m not forgetting your contribution. But 
</p>
<p>there comes a time,
Dr. Neumann, when

<p>&lt;&lt; Describing
weapons.  &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; &ldquo;Like
Lola Banks.&rdquo; &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>

NOTES.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I once did one of
those personality tests.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; OK: The
Manager says they&rsquo;re interested in making super soldiers. He
says Lola&rsquo;s got an EMP in her chest. Explains how it works. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;
I want to end here with Charlie busting the fuck out, don&rsquo;t I?
I think so. I think Charlie says he&rsquo;s got to get back to Lola,
and the Manager says Lola is taken care of. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;
I think the Manager should make it very clear to Charlie that there&rsquo;s
only one way out here. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;
Charlie leaps out through the drapes. They protect him from shattered
glass. Then he grabs Lola and they run off. I think he cleans out the
Repo of parts, too. Maybe some guards shoot at him. It&rsquo;s a cool
action scene. Come up with some unusual things. And remember Charlie
is not tough. He&rsquo;s a smart guy afraid for his life with some
kick ass legs. &gt;&gt;</p>
