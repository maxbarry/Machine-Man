something Soviet-era,

<p>with only the vaguest idea of what all the gears and levers did. And
I would try to co-ordinate the levers, but there were hundreds of

<p><em>College</em>,
I would tell my junior high self, <em>no-one is impressed if
you can throw a frisbee. Not in the circles you&rsquo;ll be mixing.</em>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>a<em>the
closest you&rsquo;ll come to physical exercise is watching liberal
arts majors play frisbee on the library front lawn.</em>

<p>By the end of high school, you don&rsquo;t even need to be able to
catch.

<p>I never wanted to swap with those kids. I kind of pitied them, as
they did me. 
</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to imply that they got it easy. I didn&rsquo;t
want to swap with them. I&rsquo;m just trying to make the point that
I have never really believed my body is on my side.</p>
<p>Gym class, on the other hand, was fifty minutes of frustration and
humiliation. I felt like I was at the controls of some ridiculously
over-complicated machine, maybe something Soviet-era, with only the
vaguest idea of what all the gears and levers did. And I would try to
co-ordinate the levers, but there were hundreds of them, and it was
just impossible. I could watch a ball coming toward me with a perfect
understanding of the forces acting upon it and the parabola it would
describe, and still drop the catch. Teammates would look at me with
faces of disgust and betrayal and I felt exactly the same way. My
body had let me down again.</p>
