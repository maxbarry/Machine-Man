<p>I raised my head. I
was in an operating theater. Now I remembered: I had been wheeled in
here for surgery. But the room was not right. Things lay scattered
and overturned: a trolley, drip stands, equipment that looked like
someone should be keeping it sterile. An electric saw, its blade dark
with what I could only assume was blood. Surgical blades glimmered at
me from the tiles, shimmering when hit by raindrops. The doorway
looked cracked, as if it had suffered a serious blow to its
structural integrity. I thought: <em>Earthquake?</em></p>
<p>I heard the
coughing again, and tried to sit up. The way I did this was to plant
my right hand on the table and lever myself up with my left elbow. It
was a method that had worked well enough in the past. This time,
though, I collapsed halfway through. I looked at my left arm, to see
what the problem was, and saw: I was in serious trouble.</p>
<p>I had been brought
here for surgery. It had not completed, obviously: I still had
fingers. But it had started. Someone had begun to sever my left arm
from my shoulder. They had almost made it all the way through. From
the gash they had left, blood pumped enthusiastically. I was lying in
a pool of it.</p>
<p>Panic jolted
through me. This was the kind of wound that killed you, very quickly.
