<p>I raised my head. I
was in an operating theater. Of course I was: I had been brought here
for surgery. But things lay scattered and overturned: a trolley, drip
stands, equipment that looked like someone should be keeping it
sterile. Surgical blades glimmered from the floor tiles in rapidly
pooling water, like coins in a wishing well. There was a chunk out of
the doorway and a long crack running up the wall. I thought:
<em>Earthquake?</em></p>
<p>I heard the
coughing again. I planted my right hand on the table and levered
myself up with my left elbow, to see who this was, but it didn&rsquo;t
work. I looked down to see what the problem was, and realized: I was
in serious trouble.</p>
<p>Blood pumped
enthusiastically from a gash in my left shoulder. No, <em>gash</em> was
the wrong word. That implies a cut in something that is mostly whole.
This was the opposite. I had a thin chunk of skin and muscle
connecting me an arm that was otherwise severed. On the tiles, as if
discarded there, was something I had mistaken for a drill. But it
wasn&rsquo;t: it had a long, flat blade. It was a saw. Liquid red
ribbons threaded the water around it. I had been brought in for
surgery. They had not finished. But they had started.</p>
