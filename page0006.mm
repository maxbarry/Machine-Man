<p>In my
third week at the hospital I was visited by the prosthetics
specialist. She walked into my room with a bunch of artificial legs
under each arm, like a Hindu goddess. &ldquo;Hi, Charlie.&rdquo; She
dumped the legs onto the bed and pushed her glasses up her nose. She
had mousy brown hair dragged mercilessly into a pony-tail. Her white
shirt was at least two sizes too big. There was no longer any danger
of confusing her with a deity. &ldquo;I hear you got a transfemoral.
Can I look?&rdquo; Before I could respond, she lifted up my sheet.
Her eyes lit up. &ldquo;Oh, wow. That&rsquo;s a clean stump. Can I
touch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her fingers probed my wounded flesh.
&ldquo;Oh. Yeah. This is a really nice job. I have to tell you, I
really like a good transfemoral. We get a lot of transtibials, and,
no offense to those people, but it&rsquo;s like fitting shoes.
There&rsquo;s no art to it. This...&rdquo; She patted my thigh. &ldquo;This
gives us options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like options,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;I am a fan of options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled. &ldquo;You and me, Charlie.
We&rsquo;re going to be friends.&rdquo;</p>
