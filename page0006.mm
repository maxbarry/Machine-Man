<p>In my
third week I was visited by the prosthetics specialist. She walked
into my room with a bunch of artificial legs under each arm, like a
Hindu goddess. &ldquo;Hi, Charlie.&rdquo; She dumped the legs onto
the bed and pushed her glasses up her nose. There was no longer any
danger you would confuse her with a deity. Her mousey brown hair was
dragged into a merciless pony-tail; around the armpits, her white
shirt looked damp. &ldquo;I hear you got a transfemoral. Can I
look?&rdquo; Before I could respond, she was lifting up my sheet. Her
eyes lit up. &ldquo;Oh, wow. That&rsquo;s a clean stump. Can I
touch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her fingers probed my wounded flesh.
&ldquo;Oh. Yeah. This is a really nice job.&rdquo; Her eyes met mine.
&ldquo;I have to tell you, I really like a good transfemoral. We get
a lot of transtibials, and no offense to those people, but it&rsquo;s
like fitting shoes. There&rsquo;s no art to it. This...&rdquo; She
patted my blighted thigh. &ldquo;This gives us options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like options,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;I am a fan of options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled. &ldquo;You and me, Charle.
We are going to be great friends.&rdquo;</p>
