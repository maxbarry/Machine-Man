<p>&ldquo;The new
functionality required more power,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We had to
move beyond the pocket reactor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could see that
now. &lt;&lt;Different shape.&gt;&gt; &ldquo;So where&rsquo;s the
reactor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the
torso.&rdquo; &lt;&lt; She touched this. &gt;&gt; &ldquo;This made a
lot of sense to all our people. You have a single supply around the
abdomen region which can feed power to any and all components.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means
they&rsquo;re not modular. They&rsquo;re dependent on a single
source.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I
don&rsquo;t know what to tell you, Charlie. This is the direction the
team took without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I chewed my lip.
&ldquo;So... to wear the legs I also need a torso unit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;
She hesitated. &ldquo;And actually, the torso unit requires a spine
upgrade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It weighs
like eight hundred kilograms,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Without that,
it&rsquo;d fall right out of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we&rsquo;re
doing the spine... well...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held up her
hands. &ldquo;You can just do the spine. It&rsquo;s totally up to
you. It&rsquo;ll just push a little on your lungs and stomach, is
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t
sound good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
workable. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s comfortable. But you can do
it.&rdquo; She bit her lip. &ldquo;The alternative, of course, is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do the
entire torso.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes lit up.
&ldquo;Exactly. Then you have no interface issues with the arms.
Otherwise... well, I&rsquo;m telling you things you already know. But
the more places you try to connect meat to metal, the more chance
something will go wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>the hard part is
always matching old and new. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;What does
that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t
leave much room for your stomach.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
totally up to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;So...
I could... have... new parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery
hesitated. Then she nodded. &ldquo;All right. Let&rsquo;s show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>But we won&rsquo;t
have any trouble fitting you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;ll
do is stop by and get you into a new set of legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suffice to say,
Charlie, we have plenty of parts. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She was walking
alongside me as a lab assistant wheeled me down a corridor. For such
a short person, she could really motor. &ldquo;We ran out of space.
Not all the new products are completely workable, of course, but...
well, 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;We can get
you into a new set of legs, a hand, right now.&rdquo; She navigated a
turn without a backward glance. &ldquo;Or...&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
Lola?&rdquo; I felt cold. &ldquo;Did I... where&rsquo;s Lola?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
She nodded. &ldquo;Arms.&rdquo; She opened her mouth, as if to say
something else, then closed it.</p>
<p>I took a breath.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so sudden.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Finish
with either CC imploring Charlie, you&rsquo;re our only hope, you
need to be top of your game to compete with Carl, or: Show me. I
think Show Me, save the former for the pre-req conversation. And put
the crouch there too.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>, because I was
worried that if I did, the delicate porcelien of the world would
shatter and fall to pieces.</p>
<p>Cassandra Cautery
crouched in front of me. This seemed unnecessary to me, because it
reversed our height differential without significantly reducing it. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>And not just arms.
We have a pelvis. A lower torso that regulates energy 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Arms.
Pelvis. Torso. We have a range.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Mention
sheilding. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Actually,
the pre-reqs should require it. That&rsquo;d be a good page for
tomorrow. The pre-reqs. &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; This week
I think they maybe prepare for Carl, but he doesn&rsquo;t come. So
then they bulk up a little more. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; The big
story here is Charlie getting new parts. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; soft
sciences: Charlie asks Lola about id. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Id comprises the unorganised
part of the personality structure that contains the basic drives. It
acts according to the pleasure principle, seeking to avoid pain or
unpleasure. </em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A low, keening
noise came out of Lola.

<p>&ldquo;Think of
Better Future as a machine with eight thousand employees. An
artificial intelligence programmed to shift resources around to
generate wealth and power.&rdquo;</p>
