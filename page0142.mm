<p>&ldquo;The Threes
draw more power,&rdquo; said Cassandra Cautery. &ldquo;We had to
replace the pocket reactor. Which, frankly, was not very well
shielded. We were a little surprised you didn&rsquo;t go Three Mile
Island, what with all the leaping and kicking of cars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ran my fingers
down the the Contours. The calves were definitely slimmer. &ldquo;What
did you use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bigger
reactor.&rdquo; She wandered away. I exhaled. Having her hovering was
making me tense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t
look bigger,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It looks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which we put
in an abdomen unit.&rdquo; I turned. She was standing beside a low
shelf, on which sat a steel object about the size of vaccuum cleaner.
On one side was stamped the international warning symbol for
radiation. &ldquo;This baby provides juice not just for the legs but
any other components you care to hook in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But... but
then the legs aren&rsquo;t modular. They&rsquo;re not
self-sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought
you&rsquo;d be pleased,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Our people thought
this was a real step forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! It&rsquo;s
not!&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t sure why I was so outraged. This wasn&rsquo;t
a terrible design. It just felt wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I
don&rsquo;t know what to tell you, Charlie. This is the direction the
team took after you ran off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I chewed my lip.
&ldquo;So... to wear the legs I need the abdomen unit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. Also,
the abdomen requires a spine upgrade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It weighs
like eight hundred kilograms. Without some spine work, it&rsquo;d
fall right out of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I eyed the abdomen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we&rsquo;re
doing the spine... well...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can just
do the spine. It&rsquo;s just...&rdquo; She shrugged. &ldquo;Well,
it&rsquo;ll push on your internal organs some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t
sound good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not sure it&rsquo;s comfortable. But you can probably live with it.
It&rsquo;s totally your choice. I will say, though, that if you do
replace the chest, it gives you a much better spread of arm options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was silent. This
still felt wrong. I abruptly realized why: these were not my parts. I
had not built them. They were deviations from my designs. It was like
coming home to the woman I loved, only to find she had changed in&mdash;</p>
<p>The shutters
rattled up. &ldquo;<em>Where&rsquo;s Lola?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s
coming.&rdquo; Cassandra Cautery looked at the doorway, as if Lola
might suddenly walk in. She didn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Charlie,
unfortunately, the clock is ticking. Do you want the parts? Or not?&rdquo;</p>
